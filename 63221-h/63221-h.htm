<p>This is a book of Travels in Virginia during a period that
may be called revolutionary, from the year 1769 to the year
1802, when the United States lay still to the east of France
and Spain, and the limit of Virginia to the west was the
river Ohio: it was a proud commonwealth, and with reason,
territorially, in the character of its ruling people, and in that
inexplicable inheritance which has made Virginia significant.
It is interesting to observe, among these travellers, how carefully
the best informed of them estimate the strength of Virginia,
whether justly or not regarded at home and here and
there abroad as the most influential of the new states. Those
were extraordinary years in the making of America, the fund
of the capital of the country, as it were, accumulating to the
point of application in surprising ways. It is well to look
back, through foreign eyes, and see a little of what the situation
was at that time in the State of the first dynasty.</p>

<p>Of these travellers, one was in the country before the war
and his memoranda introduce the Revolution&mdash;very peaceful,
then disturbances, and then musquetry, the author shooting
for King George; another came with the good King&#8217;s
troops and saw Virginia on parole; one was a chaplain in
the army of the allies, one a general officer of that army, and
there was a surgeon to the enemies from Hesse, whose book
is excellent in a series of remarkable books. The others came
after the war, men of science, youngsters seeing the world, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
missionary, a sad emigrant from France, and a sailor who
had quitted the sea and embarked in the novelist&#8217;s business.
A notable group of observers, and if, even where they are
most explicit, we could see but a small part of what they intend
us to see, what a picture. From year&#8217;s end to year&#8217;s
end, decade to decade, the century is out, and everything is
different; and to come at the truth of the matter as it was
before we should have to retrace every step of the way, and
that is impossible. As a makeshift we read novels and documented
histories.</p>

<p>The method in the chapters following has been to let the
traveller tell his own story, interrupting him where he seems
least interesting, adding very little, making him responsible
for his version of the facts. It is not so much the itemized
account that is wanted as the proceeds of the whole, the general
balance as one impression. As many travellers, so many
roads and they may follow but one. The young man will be
apt to lose his temper and record disagreeable things. The
great man, treated with consideration, will, if his digestion
is good, be careful to be polite. The season will be a factor,
for earth roads are not the same winter and summer. However,
we should not be greatly deceived by the verdicts of
eleven intelligent men who traverse the greater part of a
given region during a space of thirty years.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JOHN FERDINAND DALZIEL SMYTH, it appears,
changed his name in 1793 to Stuart. Smyth&#8217;s last published
work was a poem in folio called &#8220;Destiny and
Fortitude: An Heroic Poem on the Misfortunes of the House
of Stuart.&#8221; His father, Wentworth Smyth, was killed in
the Highlands of Scotland after being concerned in the attempt
to bring in the Stuarts in 1745. J. F. D. Smyth
studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He came
to America possibly about 1769, and settled at first near
Williamsburg as a physician. He was active in the Revolution,
and for a time drew a pension of &pound;300 a year for his
losses sustained in America. He was killed accidentally in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
London in 1814. In this case there is nothing in a name,
because in tracing Smyth from the title page of his best
known work, his &#8220;Tour in the United States,&#8221; nothing can
be discovered about him. It is only by chance that in looking
up Smyth the eye falls upon Stuart. Although he was in
most of the English colonies, and saw the greater part of the
Spanish possessions in Louisiana and Florida, Captain
Smyth preferred the Potomac region, and lived there, both
peacefully and adventurously, until finally disturbed by the
war. He was not a Tory, because he was not strictly an
American. In 1778, his correspondence proves, he was a
captain in the Queen&#8217;s Rifles. Two years before he had been
ingeniously farming some six hundred acres of good land
on the Maryland side of the Potomac. Captain John Ferdinand
Dalziel Smyth, explorer, planter, fighter and author,
was (from his own account) not unlike the more famous
Smith, who, if he had chosen, could have spelled the name
with a y as well.</p>

<p>John F. D. Smyth came in sight of land on the 4th day
of August (he neglects to give the year), &#8220;in the forenoon,
in a fine day, with a clear, serene sky. We soon sailed within
the capes of Virginia, Cape Henry and Cape Charles, which
last is an island named Smith&#8217;s. We past Lynhaven Bay
on our left, and the opening of the Chesapeak on the right,
and in the evening anchored in Hampton Road, which appears
to be very safe. The night being calm, we were assaulted
by great numbers of musketoes, a very noxious fly.&#8221;
After a day the ship proceeded to Jamestown, &#8220;passing a
great number of most charming situations on each side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
this beautiful river.&#8221; Jamestown still sent a member to the
House of Burgesses, but there was only one voter, who was
the proprietor of the borough and also the Burgess, Champion
Travers, Esq. Making an excursion with a companion to
Williamsburg, with which town Captain Smyth was well
pleased, they &#8220;dined very agreeably at the Raleigh Tavern,
where we had exceeding good Maderia.&#8221; What with pocket
boroughs and good Maderia, the traveler must have felt as
if he had scarcely left home.</p>

<p>The author describes Williamsburg, that capital city, but
being fond of sports, he gives most space to the races: &#8220;Very
capital horses are started here, such as would make no despicable
figure at Newmarket; nor is their speed, bottom or
blood inferior to their appearance. Their stock is from old
Cade, old Crab, old Partner, Regulus, Babraham, Bosphorus,
Devonshire Childers, the Cullen Arabian, the Cumberland
Arabian, &amp;c., in England; and a horse from Arabia
named the Bellsize, which was imported into America and
is now in existence.&#8221; The quarter-racing of Southern Virginia
and North Carolina struck Smyth as being a strange
institution. Many early travelers devote a page or two to
the quarter-race, a match between two horses to run one-quarter
of a mile straight out. Smyth observes: &#8220;They have
a breed in Virginia that performs it with astonishing velocity,
beating every other for that distance with great ease;
but they have no bottom. However, I am confident that there
is not a horse in England, nor perhaps the whole world, that
can excel them in rapid speed; and these likewise make excellent
saddle horses for the road. The Virginians, of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
ranks and denominations, are excessively fond of horses, and
especially those of the race breed. Nobody walks on foot the
smallest distance, except when hunting; indeed, a man will
frequently go five miles to catch a horse, to ride only one
mile afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Returning from Williamsburg to Jamestown, Smyth
joined the ship again, which, on the 9th of August, got &#8220;under
weigh&#8221; for City Point. They passed many delightful situations
and charming seats, the names of which are still well
known either actually or historically. At City Point the
genial author hired a boat and four negroes for a dollar and
a half per day to continue up the river to Richmond. &#8220;I
slept on board the boat, and on the 11th, in the forenoon,
landed at the town of Shokoes, at the falls of James River.
There are three towns at this place. Richmond, the largest,
is below the falls, and is separated only by a creek, named
Shokoes, from the town of Shokoes. On the south side of
the river stands the town of Chesterfield, best known by the
name of Rocky Ridge.&#8221; In those days the river was the road
to town. Tobacco was boated down to Westham, seven miles
above the falls, and thence brought by land carriage to Shokoes,
or Richmond. Smyth speaks of a man who, bringing
a double load down to Westham, unconsciously kept on,
passed all the falls, and arrived not quite sobered at Shokoes.
&#8220;This is one of the most extraordinary accidents that has
occurred, or perhaps was ever heard of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great rivers of America, the great forests, the fierce
electrical storms, the strange methods of agriculture, the
lightning bugs, the mosquitoes and the bullfrogs astonished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the European. Of the bullfrog, Smyth remarks: &#8220;Their
note is harsh, sonorous and abrupt, frequently appearing to
pronounce articulate sounds, in striking resemblance to the
following words: Hogshead tobacco, knee deep, ancle deep,
deeper and deeper, Piankitank, and many others, but all
equally grating and dissonant. They surprise a man exceedingly,
as he will hear their hoarse, loud bellowing clamor
just by him, and sometimes all around him, yet he cannot
discover from whence it proceeds. They are of the size of
a man&#8217;s foot.&#8221; Bullfrogs by day and the falls by night:
&#8220;When a person arrives at Richmond his ears are continually
assailed with the prodigious noise and roaring of the
falls, which almost stuns him and prevents him from sleeping
for several nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richmond was close to nature in those days. Captain
Smyth used to take walks among the rocks and solitary romantic
situations around the falls. His custom was to carry
a book in his pocket, and read in the shade until he &#8220;insensibly
dropt asleep. This was my daily recreation, which I
never neglected. But I was once extremely surprised at beholding,
as soon as I opened my eyes, a prodigious large
snake, within a few feet of me, basking himself in the sun.
He was jet black, with a copper-coloured belly, very fine,
sparkling eyes, and at least seven feet long.&#8221;</p>

<p>August 28th Smyth set out for the South. Crossing the
James in a ferry-boat early in the morning, he rode through
the towns of Rocky Ridge and Warwick (about five miles
beyond), stopped at Osborne&#8217;s, eight miles from Warwick,
and reached Blandford in the afternoon, having crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Appomattox by a lofty wooden bridge at the town of Pocahontas,
one of the three towns at the falls of the Appomattox&mdash;Petersburg,
Blandford, Pocahontas. &#8220;In Blandford,
the charming, pretty town of Blandford, in a beautiful plain
on the river brink, on a very pleasant and delightful spot, I
found an excellent ordinary at Boyd&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smyth purchased two horses at Petersburg. For the best
he gave &pound;15 and the worst cost him &pound;25. On the 4th of September
he left Blandford and rode fifteen miles to Hatton&#8217;s
Ordinary, and thence to the Nottoway River, at Swede&#8217;s
Bridge. &#8220;I arrived at Stewart&#8217;s Ordinary to breakfast,
which was toasted Indian hoecake and very excellent cyder.
Being always particularly careful of my horses, and they
having fared very indifferently the night before, I ordered
the hostler to give them plenty of meat.&#8221; The hostler understanding
meat to mean meat, put bacon before these Petersburg
horses. A crowd assembled, and this new balanced
ration became a great joke. The horses having been fed
corn, which, after all, is a form of bacon, the party proceeded
to Three Creeks, crossed them on three wooden bridges, and
then crossed the Meherrin at Hicks&#8217;s Bridge, &#8220;remarkably
lofty and built of timber, as all in the southern part of America
appear to be.&#8221; Near Hicks&#8217;s Bridge<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> (and ford) lived
Mr. Willis, breeder of the original stock of triumphant quarter
racers. &#8220;We took some refreshment at Edwards&#8217;s Ordinary,
an exceedingly good building, with excellent accommodations,
lately erected at this place. At the distance of ten
miles we entered the province of North Carolina.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>Smyth mentions that the James River lowgrounds produced
twenty-five, thirty, and sometimes thirty-five bushels
of wheat from one of seed; the high land from eight to fifteen
for one. &#8220;Much about the same quantity of Indian corn
is produced from an acre, according to the quality and excellence
of the soil, though it does not require more than a peck
of seed to plant it. The produce of an acre in the culture of
tobacco, in the best land, is about 1,660 pounds weight; on
the worst about 500 pounds weight. An acre always contains
nearly 1,250 hills of Indian corn, with two, three, and
sometimes in strong land, four stalks in each hill, or about
5,000 plants of tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the summer-time, says Captain Smyth, the average
planter &#8220;rises in the morning about 6 o&#8217;clock [the very rich
men, he says, rose at 9]; he then drinks a julep, made of
rum, water and sugar, but very strong; then he walks, or
more generally rides, round his plantation, views all his stock
and all his crop, breakfasts about 10 o&#8217;clock on cold turkey,
cold meat, fried hominy, toast and cyder, ham, bread and
butter, tea, coffee or chocolate, which last, however, is seldom
tasted but by the women; the rest of the day he spends in
much the same manner before described [i. e., in trying to
keep cool]; he eats no supper; they never even think of it.
The women very seldom drink tea in the afternoon, the men
never.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Smyth, as already described (following his tour
as he gives it), landed at Norfolk, saw Williamsburg, Richmond
and Petersburg, and from Petersburg set out for Halifax,
in North Carolina. From Halifax he took the Hillsborough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Road and thence passed to Camden, in South Carolina,
coming back to Hillsborough as a base from whence to
proceed to Kentucky, better known at that time as Henderson&#8217;s
Settlement. Smyth saw Judge Henderson<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> in North
Carolina, and had much talk with him, thought him an extraordinary
man, and became curious to see the wonderful
country beyond the Holston and the Big Sandy, the proprietary
regions of Western Virginia. &#8220;From the conversation
I had with this very extraordinary person, Mr. Henderson,
I entertained a strong inclination to pay a visit to his domain;
which must certainly afford a large field for speculation
and enterprise, being situated in the very heart of the
continent of America, and in a great degree precluded from
the general intercourse of the rest of mankind, being likewise
several hundred miles from any other settlement.&#8221; This
was before the establishment of the county of Kentucky in
1776. After that year the number of emigrants from the
coast country was so large it is almost a matter of surprise
that anybody was left in Virginia east of the mountains.</p>

<p>Smyth made a rather difficult journey from Hillsborough
to the North Carolina line. That was the back road in those
times, which the Southern Railway has done so much to develop
in recent years. In 1772 the road was scarcely a blazed
path through the woods. Near the North Carolina line Captain
Smyth stayed for about ten days at the upper and the
lower Sawra Towns, old Indian settlements south of Dan
River. &#8220;The whole settlement of the Lower Sawra Towns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
being a vast body of excellent and most valuable land containing
33,000 acres, of which more than 9,000 are exceedingly
rich low grounds, is the property of Mr. Farley, of the
island of Antigua, in the West Indies. About the year 1761
the whole of this extensive tract of land was sold to Mr. Maxwell,
who concluded the purchase without seeing it. In the
spring of the ensuing year he went out to view his new estate.
It happened just at that time that a prodigious flood
in the Dan had overspread the whole of the lowgrounds on
the river, of which near 10,000 acres were covered by the
inundation. This extraordinary circumstance and very awful
appearance astonished and intimidated Mr. Maxwell, who
on his return to Westover, expressing dissatisfaction with
his purchase, the &pound;500 was returned to him. That same year
Mr. Farley, of Antigua, being on a visit in Virginia, immediately
offered &pound;1,000 for the purchase, without ever having
seen it also; which offer was as readily accepted. In the year
1769 Mr. Farley&#8217;s son, James Farley, came into Virginia,
and ventured out that distance in the back country to view
the estate. After some difficulty in removing accidental
settlers, he divided the tract into numerous plantations and
farms which he rented out, keeping in his own hands a most
valuable, excellent tract, the choice of the whole. In short,
the value of this estate has augmented so exceedingly that in
the year 1772 Mr. Farley refused &pound;28,000 for the purchase
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This transaction is interesting enough, as showing what
the apparent opportunities were for land speculation in the
later colonial period, and yet how impossible it was for any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
exclusive business of that sort to succeed on a large scale.
General Washington owned more than 500,000 acres of land
to the west, the proceeds of which to his estate were not very
considerable. Robert Morris, the shrewd financier, went
bankrupt in attempting to develop the western country as a
field for the operator in real estate. There was a continent
of land to be exploited, and it was very difficult to corner
even a small part of the market. The land could not be handled
as capital until a sufficient number of settlers had come
in, each contributing his accumulations to enhance the value
of the common stock. It was from the necessity of the case
a common stock at the first, and the pioneers were not long
in finding that out.</p>

<p>In his journey to Kentucky, Captain Smyth happened
upon some of these pioneers. His observations confirm the
belief that the hero is a hero, but also a very fallible person.
&#8220;On the 15th day of May I took my leave of Mr. Bailey and
his family (at the Lower Sawra Towns), every one of whom
seemed to be really more concerned for my safety than I
could possibly have conceived, being all in tears and appearing
almost certain that I should be destroyed by the savages;
having used their most earnest persuasions and utmost endeavors
to change my resolution of proceeding on this journey.
The kind-hearted and truly amiable Miss Betsy Bailey
insisted on piloting me over the Dan herself, rather than any
of her brothers, although the ford at this place was exceedingly
rapid, rocky and dangerous. In a very few hours, by
pursuing the wrong path, I found myself in the woods without
any track whatever to direct my course, that in which I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
had been having terminated, being only made by the hogs,
which run wild almost all over America, and especially in
the Western frontiers. It is impossible for me to ascertain
how far I had traveled in this most disagreeable of all imaginable
situations, when all on a sudden, on the side of a
gentle ascent, I perceived a number of men sitting on the
ground, and such they were as I had never seen before,
painted black and red and all armed with firelocks and tomahawks.&#8221;</p>

<p>These were Indians, and they were very hospitable to
Smyth. He gave them the stone buckle and gold lace from
the crown of his hat. &#8220;They seemed much pleased with the
present and made signs for me to sit down and eat with them.
This I readily complied with, and partook of a repast which
consisted of venison, kernels of hickory nuts and wallnuts,
all mixed together with wild honey, and every one eat with
his hands. Having a keen appetite I eat very heartily, which
seemed to afford a particular satisfaction to my hospitable
savage friends, for such indeed they were to me.&#8221; Smyth
spent the night with these warriors (they were really on the
war path), and the next morning one of them put him into
the way to Beaver Creek, upon Smith&#8217;s River, in what was
then Pittsylvania County.</p>

<p>Along Leatherwood Creek, Captain Smyth, the bold tourist,
saw several fine plantations deserted of the owners. The
cattle and horses were wandering about and presented a very
mournful, melancholy appearance. Reports of the movements
of the Indians had driven the inhabitants to the fort
on Smith&#8217;s River. About eight miles beyond Leatherwood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Creek (Patrick Henry lived on that stream for a year or two
after the Revolution) a man appeared on horseback, whose
horse was covered with foam and sweat. He was astonished
beyond measure when Smyth told him he had come from the
Sawra Towns and had eaten and slept with a party of Indians.
&#8220;In riding about two or three miles further I at
length came to the fort itself, which contained all the inhabitants
of the country around. I was exceedingly happy at
the thought of being once more among inhabitants, but this
imaginary felicity was of very short duration, for when I
went to the gate of the fort expecting to go in, I was positively
refused admittance. They within insisted that I was
an enemy or a Frenchman because I had been in company
with the Indians and had escaped unmolested, and also as
my accent was different from theirs. This I found they were
informed of by the man I met on horseback, and who turned
back full speed as soon as I acquainted him of my having
been with the Indians. I continued to entreat for admittance
until they threatened to fire upon me if I did not retire, which
made me withdraw from the gate to consider what steps I
must pursue, for I never found myself in so singular and
unpleasant a predicament in my life. I wandered round and
round this fortress until night began to advance, and then
ventured to approach the gate once more. They again threatening
to shoot me, I assured them that I would as soon be
killed by them as by the Indians, and solemnly swore I would
set fire to the stockades. Upon this I was desired to wait a
few minutes, until they consulted together; at the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of which they agreed to admit me. The wicker gate was then
opened and I crept in.&#8221; The conditions inside, of necessity,
were not very agreeable.</p>

<p>How exactly truthful Captain Smyth is it is not possible
to say. By his account after a few days at the fort he procured
a guide and set out for the mountains, regardless of
the Indians. He had heard of the Wart Mountain<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and
climbed that eminence for the view which, as he describes it,
was an amazing prospect. Doubtless with a map before him
he was able to include in his description more than the eye
fell upon. &#8220;Language fails in attempting to describe this
most astonishing and almost unbounded perspective. On
the east you could perceive the deep and broken chasms,
where the rivers Dan, Mayo, Smith&#8217;s, Bannister&#8217;s and Stanton
direct their courses; some raging in vast torrents and
some gliding in silent, gentle meanders. On the north you
see the Black Water, a branch of the Stanton; and the break
in the mountains where the Fluvannah, a vast branch of the
James, passes through. On the northwest you will observe
with great astonishment and pleasure the tremendous and
abrupt break in the Alegany Mountains, through which the
mighty waters of the New River and the Great Kanhawah
pass. On the west you can very plainly discover the three
forks or branches of the Holston, where they break through
the Great Alegany Mountains, and still beyond them you
may observe Clinch&#8217;s River or Pelisippi. On the south you
can see the Dan, the Catawba, the Yadkin and the Haw,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
breaking through the mighty mountains that appear in confused
heaps and piled on each other in every direction.&#8221; It
is safe to say that Smyth did not see all this. But the description
is interesting. Many voyagers to the West must
have beheld scenes comparable, with thoughts more or less
defined that here was a land for the possessing and a new
world indeed.</p>

<p>From the Wart Mountain Captain Smyth continued, by
way of New River, the branches of the Holston (Stahlnaker&#8217;s
Settlement on the middle fork), Clinch River and
the Warrior&#8217;s branch to the Kentucky River. &#8220;In five more
easy days&#8217; journeys, the particulars of which are not worth
relating, we at length arrived at the famed settlement near
the mouth of the Kentucky on the 8th day of June, after
having traveled at least 490 miles, from the fort on Smith&#8217;s
River, in nineteen days. I was soon directed to the house of
Mr. Henderson, where I found a most hospitable and kind
reception.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that outpost of Virginia Captain Smyth passed
down the Ohio to the territories of Spain, along the Gulf
coast by water to East Florida, and so to Charleston.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">GENERAL BURGOYNE, of amiable qualities but of
no great skill as a commander, having had the misfortune
to lose his army at Saratoga, in the month of
October, 1777, a convention was agreed upon, stipulating the
treatment to be accorded the defeated troops. Thereafter,
until exchanged, these Saratoga troops were known among
themselves as the Convention Army. The art of saving one&#8217;s
face is one of the most intricate yet in existence. Young
Thomas Anburey, who was perhaps a lieutenant in the Twenty-ninth
Regiment of Foot under General Burgoyne, surrendered
with his brother officers, and with them was sent
first to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and later to Virginia. Anburey,
a very cheerful young person, kept a sort of journal of
his military and other travels in America, and worked up his
notes into the form of letters to a friend. His observations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
are not profound, but are marked by good sense and ingenuousness,
and make much better reading than more pretentious
narratives.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>After being quartered for more than a year in Massachusetts,
Anburey and his friends were sent South, in order to
shift the incidence of taxation in the matter of subsistence
for so many able-bodied men, numbers of whom (the Hessians,
for instance) no doubt had in America their first opportunity
of getting at least one square meal a day. &#8220;Especially
the Germans,&#8221; says Anburey, &#8220;who seeing in what a comfortable
manner their countrymen live, left us in great numbers,
as we marched through New York, the Jerseys and Pennsylvania;
among the number of deserters is my servant, who,
as we left Lancaster, ran from me with my horse, portmanteau,
and everything he could take with him.&#8221; It was at
best a strange spectacle, this of an army of desirable citizens
marching captive through an abounding wilderness, and
merely on parole.</p>

<p>From Lancaster the Convention Army moved to Frederick
Town, in Maryland, where they spent Christmas Day, 1778.
The commissary of provisions at Frederick, Mr. McMurdo,
was very polite to the officers quartered at his house. Anburey
says: &#8220;His attention was such that although for this
day (which is as much a day of festival as in England), he
had been engaged for some time past among his friends and
relations, he would stay at home and entertain us with an
excellent Christmas dinner, not even forgetting plum pudding.
I now experienced what had been often told me, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the further I went to the southward I should find the inhabitants
possess more liberality and hospitality.&#8221; Anburey&#8217;s
impressions of the North, of course, were formed rather precipitately
at Saratoga.</p>

<p>Charlottesville, almost a frontier town then, was the destination
of the Convention Army. &#8220;After we left Frederick
Town we crossed the Potowmack River with imminent danger,
as the current was very rapid, large floats of ice swimming
down it; though the river was only half a mile wide,
the scow that I crossed over in had several narrow escapes.
At one time it was quite fastened in the ice, but by great exertions
of the men in breaking it, we made good our landing
on the opposite shore, near a mile lower than the ferry.&#8221;
And the river crossed, hardships only increased on the Virginia
side. The roads were bad from a late fall of snow not
sufficiently encrusted to bear a man&#8217;s weight. The troops
were continually sinking in mud up to their knees and cutting
their shins and ankles; and after a march of sixteen or
eighteen miles over such badly metalled roads, the men often
had to sleep in the woods and the officers in any cabin available.</p>

<p>&#8220;But on our arrival at Charlottesville no pen can describe
the scene of misery and confusion that ensued. The officers
of the First and Second Brigade were in the town, and our
arrival added to their distress. This famous place we had
heard so much of consisted only of a courthouse, one tavern,
and about a dozen houses, all of which were crowded with
officers. Those of our brigade, therefore, were obliged to
ride about the country and entreat the inhabitants to take us
in.&#8221; The men fared very badly. Instead of sleeping on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
snow, under the trees, they went into barracks, hastily covering
over a few cabins which had been begun but were left
unroofed, and half-filled with snow. The trouble was that
Colonel Harvey, to whom Congress had assigned the business
of getting quarters ready for the tourists, had in turn placed
his brother in charge. Colonel Harvey&#8217;s brother said that the
army was not expected until the spring. There was no whiskey
provided, the stock of provisions was scant, and the quarters
were as described of the fretwork description.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the officers, upon signing a parole they might go
to Richmond and other adjacent towns to procure themselves
quarters. Accordingly a parole was signed, which allowed a
circuit of near 100 miles. And after the officers had drawn
lots, as three were to remain in the barracks with the men,
or at Charlottesville, the principal part of them set off for
Richmond, and many of them are at plantations twenty or
thirty miles from the barracks. I was quartered, with four
other officers of our regiment, at Jones&#8217;s Plantation, about
twenty miles from the barracks. The face of the country
appears an immense forest, interspersed with various plantations,
four or five miles distant from each other. On these
there is a dwelling house in the centre, with kitchens, smoke-house
and outhouses detached, and from the various buildings
each plantation has the appearance of a small village.
At some little distance from the houses are peach and apple
orchards, and scattered over the plantation are the cabins
and tobacco houses.&#8221; The worm fence was an object of
wonder to every foreigner, and yet in a country of abundant
timber the most natural thing in the world. Anburey mentions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that in the New England settlements (where the holdings
were smaller and fences could be made with more particularity)
the inhabitants had a saying, &#8220;He is making Virginia
fences,&#8221; used of a man not sober, but able to walk, as
it were.</p>

<p>Anburey was twice at Richmond, once in the winter and
once in the summer of 1779. The neighboring gentlemen
were very hospitable, and would not let him leave until he
had visited the whole circle. He speaks especially of Warwick
and &#8220;Tuckahoe.&#8221; The proprietor of &#8220;Tuckahoe&#8221; was
threatened with the burning of valuable mills because an
English officer had been made welcome. It was an idle threat.
On the way to Richmond, by the road through Goochland
Courthouse, Anburey met that perennial, the celebrated
roundabout directions: &#8220;If perchance you meet an inhabitant
and enquire your way, his directions are, if possible, more
perplexing than the roads themselves, for he tells you to keep
the right-hand path, then you&#8217;ll come to an old field; you are
to cross that, and then you&#8217;ll come to the fence of such a one&#8217;s
plantation; then keep that fence, and you&#8217;ll come to a road
that has three forks; keep the right-hand fork for about half
a mile, and then you&#8217;ll come to a creek; after you cross that
creek you must turn to the left, and there you&#8217;ll come to a
tobacco house; after you have passed that you&#8217;ll come to another
road that forks; keep the right-hand fork, and then
you&#8217;ll come to Mr. Such-a-One&#8217;s ordinary, and he will direct
you.&#8221; The fact of such directions as these, and the use made
of them, are to be explained when we remember that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
backwoodsman carries a map in his head, whereas the cockney&#8217;s
brain is damaged by the use of maps.</p>

<p>In the woods the Convention officer came upon a track for
quarter-racing. &#8220;Near most of the ordinaries there is a piece
of ground cleared in the woods for that purpose, where there
are two paths, about six or eight yards asunder, which the
horses run in. I think I can, without the slightest exaggeration,
assert that even the famous Eclipse could not excel them
in speed, for our horses are some time before they are able
to get into full speed; but these are trained to set out in that
manner the moment of starting. It is the most ridiculous
amusement imaginable, for if you happen to be looking another
way, the race is terminated before you can turn your
head; notwithstanding which, very considerable sums are
betted at these races. Only in the interior parts of this province
are these races held, for they are much laughed at and
ridiculed by the people in the lower parts, about Richmond
and other great towns. At Williamsburg is a very excellent
course for two, three or four-mile heats.&#8221;</p>

<p>On his summer trip to Richmond, Anburey was struck by
the numbers of peach orchards in full fruit&mdash;&#8220;it is deemed
no trespass to stop and refresh yourself and your horse with
them&#8221;&mdash;and by the sight of a family leaving a most comfortable
house and good plantation to set out for Kentucky over
the mountains. The summer of 1779 apparently was a good
peach season, and a bad season in the item of forest fires.
&#8220;The town of Richmond, as well as the plantations around
for some miles, has been in imminent danger; as the woods
have been on fire, which for some time past has raged with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
great fury, and that element seemed to threaten universal
destruction; but, providentially, before it had done any material
damage there fell a very heavy rain, which, nevertheless,
has not altogether extinguished it [July 14, 1779].
During the summer months these fires are very frequent,
and at Charlottesville I have seen the mountains on a blaze
for three or four miles in length. They are occasioned by
the carelessness of waggoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the winter of 1779 the Convention Army at Charlottesville
lost heavily by desertion. &#8220;I should observe that
this desertion is among the British troops. For what reason
it is impossible to say, the Americans shew more indulgence
to the Germans, permitting them to go round the country to
labor, and being for the most part expert handicraftsmen,
they realize a great deal of money exclusive of their pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officers made themselves pretty comfortable. They
put up a coffee house, a theatre and a cold bath. Anburey
made, or had made, a drawing entitled &#8220;Encampment of the
Convention Army at Charlottes Ville, in Virginia, after they
had surrendered to the Americans.&#8221; In this interesting print
it is difficult to distinguish the theatre, but the coffee house
is easily found.</p>

<p>September, 1780, when orders came to move to the North
again, the officers were loath to go. They had understood that
they were to remain at Charlottesville until exchanged. Several
of them &#8220;had laid out great sums in making themselves
comfortable habitations; for the barracks became a little
town, and there being more society, most of the officers had
resorted there. The great objection to residing at them on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
our first arrival, was on account of the confined situation,
being not only surrounded, but even in the woods themselves.
The proprietor of the estate will reap great advantages, as
the army entirely cleared a space of six miles in circumference
around the barracks. After we quitted the barracks,
the inhabitants were near a week in destroying the cats that
were left behind, which impelled by hunger had gone into
the woods. There was reason to suppose they would become
extremely wild and ferocious and would be a great annoyance
to their poultry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Convention Army, crossing the &#8220;Pignet Ridge, or
more properly, the Blue Mountains,&#8221; at Wood&#8217;s Gap, moved
to Winchester, and thence, recrossing the Ridge at Williams&#8217;s
Gap, proceeded to Frederick Town, and so to New York to
take ship.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE FRENCH ARMY, after a voyage of eighty-five
days, landed at Boston June 24, 1781. With it came
the Abb&eacute; Robin, a philosopher who was more than
once in America and has left recorded descriptions of Louisiana
as well as of the Atlantic Coast. The Abb&eacute; Robin was
a genial, generalizing observer&mdash;his New Travels in America<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
is an interesting book, particularly in its passages with
a bearing upon the activities and the good behavior of the
Allies from France. We learn therein how the French introduced
among us the brass band and set on foot improvements
in the art of the dance: they also brought us to a
knowledge of the ancient diversion faro.</p>

<p>The New Travels of the Abb&eacute; Robin, like so many other
travellers&#8217; books of that period, are in the form of letters to
a friend. The author proceeded with the Army from Boston
to Providence, through Connecticut (where he was struck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
with traces of the &#8220;active and inventive genius&#8221; of the inhabitants),
to the Camp at Philippsburg, down the Hudson
into the Jerseys, past Philadelphia and Baltimore. He
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">Annapolis, September 21, 1781.</p>

<p>The army was to prosecute the rest of the march to Virginia
by land, and with that view took the road leading to
Alexandria, a flourishing commercial town upon the Potomack;
but upon the news of the arrival of the <i>Romulus</i> ship
of war, with two frigates and a number of transports, we
turned off towards Annapolis, but the horses and carriages
continued their journey by land.</p>

<p>As we advance towards the south we observe a sensible
difference in the manners and customs of the people. This
opulence was particularly observable at Annapolis. That
very inconsiderable town, standing at the mouth of the river
Severn, where it falls into the bay, out of the few buildings
it contains, has at least three-fourths such as may be styled
elegant and grand. The state-house is a very beautiful building,
I think the most so of any I have seen in America. The
peristyle is set off with pillars, and the edifice is topped with
a dome.</p>

<p>We are embarking with the greatest expedition; the
weather is the finest you can conceive, and the wind fair: I
think the impatience of the French will soon be at an end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">Williamsburgh, September 30, 1781.</p>

<p>The army has had a very agreeable passage hither, except
the grenadiers, chasseurs, and the first American regiments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
[these sailed from the Head of Elk], who were fourteen days
on the water. Judge how inconvenient this must have been
to troops crowded into a narrow space, and without any decks
over them; while even the officers had nothing but biscuit to
live upon. The shores of this Bay, which is formed by the
influx of so many great rivers, are far from being lofty,
neither are they much cleared of woods, and it is but rarely
that you discover any habitations; but the few we saw were
very agreeably situated. This country will be, in time, one
of the most beautiful in the world.</p>

<p>When our little fleet had sailed up James River, celebrated
for the excellent tobacco which grows upon its shores, we
disembarked at James-Town, the place where the English
first established themselves in Virginia. The troops have
already joined the grenadiers, chasseurs, and the three thousand
men brought hither by Count de Grasse, consisting of
the regiments of Agenois, Gatinois and Touraine, under the
command of Mons. de St. Simon, Mar&eacute;chal de Camp. This
General had a little before effected a junction with fifteen
hundred or two thousand Americans, commanded by M. le
Marquis de la Fayette, who, as you have heard, could never
be reduced, notwithstanding the forces of Cornwallis were
three or four times his number. I should have mentioned,
that M. de la Fayette, in quality of Major-General of an
American army, at the age of twenty-four years, found himself
at this time superior in command to a French general
officer, and continued so until the other detachments of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>Williamsburg does not contain above a hundred and fifty
houses, and is the only town we have yet seen in Virginia
worth mentioning not situated on the banks of any river.
What makes the situation of this place valuable, is the neighbourhood
of James and York rivers, between which grows
the best tobacco in the whole State, and for this reason it
seems to have been built where it is: I do not think, nevertheless,
that it will ever be a place of any great importance; the
towns of York, James, Norfolk, and Edenton, being more
favourably situated for trade, will undoubtedly eclipse it.</p>

<p>With the most lively satisfaction I contemplated these
monuments of the real glory of men, the college and the
library; and while I contemplated them, they recalled to my
mind places and persons most intimately connected with my
heart. The tumult of arms has driven from hence those who
had the care of these philosophical instruments, for the
Muses, you know, take no pleasure but in the abodes of peace:
We could only meet with one solitary professor, of Italian
extraction; and I can not but say, his conversation and abilities
appeared to be such, that after what he had told us in
commendation of his brethren, we could not help regretting
their absence.</p>

<p>About Williamsburg and the shores of the bay, the land is
covered with trees yielding rozin; the meadows and marshes
subsist great numbers of excellent horses, which far exceed
those of the other states in point of beauty: vast quantities
of hemp are raised here, as well as flax, Indian corn and
cotton: the cotton shrubs produce annually, and at the first
view we took them for beans in blossom. Silk worms succeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
here very well, and it is not improbable but they may
at some future time form one of the most considerable
branches of trade in this State. The commodity most in
demand is tobacco; you well know the character it has, and
for common use it may be considered as the best in the world.
What the English imported yearly from this State, and from
Maryland, might have amounted to about ninety-six thousand
hogsheads; but among themselves they did not consume
one sixth part of that quantity, and either disposed of the
rest among us, or exported it to the north [of Europe]; judge
then how valuable this commerce was to that nation. They
purchased it here at the very lowest rate, taking it in exchange
for their broad-clothes, linen and hard wares, and
selling again for ready money what they did not want for
their own home consumption, and thus they increased their
capital every year to the amount of eight or nine millions.
No other of their possessions, not even those in India, ever
afforded them so clear a profit. Three hundred and thirty
vessels, and about four thousand sailors were constantly employed
in this trade: of these the city of Glasgow, in Scotland,
owned the greatest part, and by that means supported
its flourishing manufactures, which were perhaps more considerable
than those of any town in England.</p>

<p>Since the war, the tobacco exportation has been only about
forty thousand hogsheads annually; what advantages then
would have accrued to the English, could they have sooner
made themselves masters of Chesapeake-bay. There are now
fifty or sixty vessels collected at York, under the cannon of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Cornwallis, sent on purpose to load with this weed, which
three fourths and a half of the human race take such supreme
delight in chewing, snuffing or smoking.</p>

<p>The army is at present before York. We hear the reports
of the cannon very distinctly; and I am now going to join
the troops, where I think I shall shortly have something very
interesting to impart to you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">Camp at York, November 6, 1781.</p>

<p>I have been through the unfortunate little town of York
since the siege, and saw many elegant houses shot through
and through in a thousand places, and ready to crumble to
pieces; rich household furniture crushed under their ruins,
or broken by the brutal English soldier; carcases of men and
horses half covered with dirt: books piled in heaps, and
scattered among the ruins of the buildings, served to give
me an idea of the tastes and morals of the inhabitants; these
were either treatises of religion or controversial divinity;
the <i>history</i> of the English nation, and their foreign settlements;
collections of charters and acts of parliament; the
works of the celebrated <i>Alexander Pope</i>; a translation of
<i>Montaigne&#8217;s Essays</i>; <i>Gil Blas de Santillane</i>, and the excellent
<i>Essay upon Women</i>, by <i>Mr. Thomas</i>.</p>

<p>The plan of the fortifications for the defence of York and
Glocester has been entirely changed; they are drawing them
into a narrower compass than before, have destroyed the English
works, and are busy at constructing new ones. The travelling
artillery is partly at Williamsburg and partly at York;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
and the heavy cannon is at West Point (called <i>Delaware</i> in
the maps), a place situated between the two rivers that form
that of York.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth [of October] the troops began to go
into winter quarters. The regiments of Bourbonnais and
Royal Deux Ponts are at Williamsburg, where our head
Quarters are fixed. The regiments of Soissonnais, and the
grenadier companies, and Chasseurs of Saintonge are at
York. The rest of the regiment of Saintonge is billetted
about in the country betwixt York and Hampton; and this
latter place, situated on James River, is occupied by the
Legion of Lauzun.</p>

<p>This great and happy event, in which the French have had
so considerable a share, will soon give a new turn to American
affairs. The Southern States, so long harassed and
distrest, will now assume new spirit and activity. To what
a pitch of grandeur will not these new states shortly arise.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;FROM the moment the French troops were established
in the quarters they occupied in Virginia, I formed
the project of traveling into the upper parts of that
province, where I was assured that I should find objects worthy
of exciting the curiosity of a stranger; and faithful to
the principles, which from my youth I had laid down, never
to neglect seeing every country in my power, I burned with
impatience to set out. The season, however, was unfavorable,
and rendered traveling difficult and laborious; besides,
experience taught me that traveling in winter never offered
the greatest satisfaction we can enjoy&mdash;that of seeing Nature
as she ought to be, and of forming a just idea of the general
face of a country; for it is easier for the imagination to deprive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the landscape of the charms of spring than to clothe
with them the hideous skeleton of winter; as it is easier to
imagine what a beauty at eighteen may be at eighty, than to
conceive what eighty was at eighteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>In these words, the Marquis of Chastellux, writing from
Williamsburg about the 1st of May, 1782, begins the chronicle
of his tour to the Valley of Virginia. He was in America
with the army perhaps two years, during which time he
sustained his reputation as a capable officer, an agreeable
man, and a philosopher of tolerant insight. M. de Chastellux
was a good traveler. In the country, if the bacon and
eggs were stale and the vintage was spring water of the
morning, he found something to admire in the landscape.
At Philadelphia he dined with members of the Congress, of
all parties, listened to political theories, drank tea with the
ladies, was easily amused and formed opinions which may be
discovered on a careful reading. Where is there a more sensible
man than the old campaigner? The Marquis of Chastellux
entered the army at fifteen, and was given command
of a regiment at twenty-one. He served with distinction in
the Seven Years&#8217; War. His studies were never neglected,
and being a man of rank he was early adopted among the
scholars.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April, 1782, M. de Chastellux set out from
Williamsburg for Rockbridge County. &#8220;On the 8th I set
out with Mr. Lynch, then my aid-de-camp and adjutant, Mr.
Frank Dillon, my second aid-de-camp, and M. le Chevalier
d&#8217;Oyr&eacute;, of the Engineers. Six servants and a led horse composed
our train, so that our little caravan consisted of four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
masters, six servants and eleven horses. I regulated my
journey by the spring, and gave it time sufficient to precede
us. The eighteen miles through which we passed before we
baited our horses at Bird&#8217;s Tavern were sufficiently known
to me, for it was the same road I traveled the year before in
coming from Williamsburg. The remaining sixteen, which
completed our day&#8217;s work and brought us to New Kent
Courthouse, offered nothing curious. All I learned by a
conversation with Mr. Bird was that he had been pillaged by
the English when they passed his house in their march to
Westover in pursuit of M. de la Fayette, and in returning
to Williamsburg after endeavoring in vain to come up with
him. Mr. Bird repeated with indignation that the refugee
camp followers had taken from him the very boots from off
his legs. As the next day&#8217;s journey was to be longer than
that of the preceding one, we left New Kent Courthouse before
8 o&#8217;clock, and rode twenty miles to Newcastle, where I
resolved to give our horses two hours repose. When the heat
was a little abated and our horses were somewhat reposed we
continued our journey that we might arrive before dark at
Hanover Courthouse, from which we were yet sixteen miles.
The country through which we passed is one of the finest of
lower Virginia. There are many well cultivated estates and
handsome houses. We arrived at Hanover Courthouse before
sunset, and alighted at a tolerable handsome inn&mdash;a very
large saloon and a covered portico to receive the company
who assemble every three months at the courthouse, either
on private or public affairs. This asylum is the more necessary,
as there are no other houses in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>From Hanover Courthouse, which, as well as New Kent,
had reason to remember the passage of the English, the party
proceeded at 9 the next morning towards Offley, the residence
for the time of General Nelson, recently Governor of the
State. &#8220;I had got acquainted with him during the expedition
to York, at which critical moment he was Governor, and
conducted himself with the courage of a brave soldier and
the zeal of a good citizen. I am sorry to add that the only
recompense of his labors was the hatred of a great part of his
fellow citizens, arising from the necessity under which he
had often labored of pressing their horses, carriages and
forage.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. de Chastellux and his aids arrived at Offley at 1 o&#8217;clock
on the 10th of April, and spent two rainy days there. General
Nelson was absent, but Secretary Nelson was there, an
old man very gouty, who related with a serene countenance
what the effect had been of the French batteries in front of
Yorktown. &#8220;The tranquility which has succeeded these unhappy
times by giving him leisure to reflect upon his losses,
has not embittered the recollection; he lives happily on one
of his plantations, where in less than six hours he can assemble
seventy of his relations, children, grandchildren, nephews
and nieces. The rapid increase of his own family justifies
what he told me of the population of Virginia in general, of
which, from the offices he has held all his life, he must have
it in his power to form a very accurate judgment. In 1742
the people subject to taxes in Virginia amounted only to the
number of 63,000; by his account they now exceed 160,000.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>&#8220;After passing two days very agreeably with this interesting
family, we left there the 12th at 10 in the morning, accompanied
by the secretary and five or six of his young relations,
who conducted us to Little River Bridge, a small creek
on the road about five miles from Offley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleven miles through woods brought them to Willis&#8217;s Ordinary,
a solitary place, but at the moment crowded. &#8220;As
soon as I alighted I inquired what might be the reason of this
numerous assembly, and was informed it was a cock fight.
This diversion is much in vogue in Virginia, where the English
customs are more prevalent than in the rest of America.
Whilst our horses were feeding we had an opportunity of
seeing a battle. The stakes were very considerable; the
money of the parties was deposited in the hands of one of
the principal persons, and I felt a secret pleasure in observing
that it was chiefly French. Whilst the interested parties
animated the cocks to battle, a child of fifteen, who was near
me, kept leaping for joy and crying, &#8216;Oh, it is a charming
diversion.&#8217; We had yet seven or eight and twenty miles to
ride to the only inn where it was possible to stop before we
reached Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping on towards Monticello, the party passed an ordinary,
some sixteen miles from Willis&#8217;s, kept by an extremely
fat man. They found him contented in an arm chair, which
served him also for a bed. A stool supported his enormous
legs. &#8220;A large ham and a bowl of grog served him for company,
like a man resolved to die surrounded by his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spent the night twelve miles farther on at a house
where there were fourteen children, not one of them ten years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
old; and set out at 8 o&#8217;clock the next morning through the
foothills of the Southwest Mountain. That day, the 13th
of April (an important day with Mr. Jefferson) they came
to Monticello. &#8220;The visit which I made Mr. Jefferson was
not unexpected, for he had long since invited me to come and
pass a few days with him; notwithstanding which I found
his first appearance serious, nay even cold; but before I had
been two hours with him we were as intimate as if we had
passed our whole lives together. Walking, books, but above
all a conversation always varied and interesting, made four
days pass away like so many minutes. I recollect with pleasure
that as we were conversing one evening over a bowl of
punch, after Mrs. Jefferson had retired, our conversation
turned on the poems of Ossian. In our enthusiasm the book
was sent for and placed near the bowl, where by their mutual
aid the night far advanced imperceptibly upon us. Sometimes
natural philosophy, at others politics or the arts, were
the topics of our conversation, for no object had escaped
Mr. Jefferson; and it seemed as if from his youth he had
placed his mind, as he had his house, on an elevated situation,
from which he might contemplate the universe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson and M. de Chastellux rode over to Charlottesville,
&#8220;a rising town,&#8221; to see Colonel Armand,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> whose
legion was in quarters there. Colonel Armand had a pet
wolf which had been caught wild in the neighborhood. M.
de Chastellux left Monticello on the 17th, and on the 19th
arrived at the Natural Bridge, by way of Rockfish Gap and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Steel&#8217;s Tavern. Returning by way of New London (Bedford),
&#8220;already a pretty considerable town, at least seventy
or eighty houses,&#8221; the party of tourists reached Cumberland
Courthouse on the 23d. &#8220;This is the chief manor house
of a very considerable country; it is situated in a plain of
about a mile diameter, sixteen miles from Hodnett&#8217;s, which
we had passed. Besides the courthouse and a large tavern,
its necessary appendage, there are seven or eight houses inhabited
by gentlemen of fortune. I found the tavern full of
people, and understood that the judges were assembled to
hold a court of claims&mdash;that is to say, to hear and register
the claims of sundry persons, who had furnished provisions
for the army. We know that in general, but particularly in
unexpected invasions, the American troops had no established
magazine, and as it was necessary to have subsistence for
them, provisions and forage were indiscriminately laid hold
of on giving the owners a receipt, which they call a certificate.
During the campaign, whilst the enemy was at hand,
little attention was given to this sort of loans, which accumulated
incessantly, without the sum total being known, or any
means taken to ascertain the proofs. Virginia being at length
loaded with these certificates, it became necessary, sooner or
later, to liquidate these accounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last Assembly of the State of Virginia had accordingly
thought proper to pass a bill, authorizing the justices
of each county to take cognizance of these certificates, to authenticate
their validity, and to register them, specifying
the value of the provisions in money, according to the established
tariff. I had the curiosity to go to the courthouse to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
see how this affair was transacted, and saw it was performed
with great order and simplicity. The justices wore their
common clothes, but were seated on an elevated tribunal, as
at London in the court of King&#8217;s bench or common pleas.
We had rode forty-four miles, and night was closing fast
upon us when we arrived at Powhatan Courthouse, a more
recent settlement than that of Cumberland. We had a good
supper and good beds, but our horses were obliged to do
without forage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 24th they left Powhatan, and
rode forty-four miles to Petersburg, passing Chesterfield
Courthouse, where were still to be seen the ruins of the barracks
occupied by the Baron Steuben and burned by the English.
At Petersburg M. de Chastellux called at &#8216;Battersea&#8217;
and was entertained at &#8216;Bollingbrook.&#8217; The town is described
as already flourishing, and destined to become more so every
day&mdash;the depot for a vast region to the south. &#8220;Five miles
from Petersburg we passed the small river of Randolph over
a stone bridge, and traveling through a rich and well peopled
country, arrived at a fork of roads, where we were unlucky
enough precisely to make choice of that which did not
lead to Richmond, the place of our destination. But we had
no reason to regret our error, as it was only two miles about
and we skirted James River to a charming place called Warwick,
where a group of handsome houses form a sort of village,
and there are several superb ones in the neighborhood.
As we had lost our way and traveled but slowly, it was near
3 o&#8217;clock when we reached Manchester, a sort of suburb to
Richmond, on the right bank of the river, where you pass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the ferry. The passage was short, there being two boats for
the accommodation of travelers. Richmond is divided into
three parts. I was conducted to that on the west, where I
found a good inn. Mr. Formicola, my landlord, is a Neapolitan,
who came to Virginia with Lord Dunmore, but had gone
rather roundabout, having been before in Russia. His only
error was the exalted idea he had formed of the manner in
which French general officers must be treated. After dinner
I went to pay a visit to Mr. Harrison, then Governor of the
State. He talked much of the first Congress in America, in
which he sat for two years. This subject led us naturally to
that which is the most favorite topic among the Americans&mdash;the
origin and commencement of the present revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>This conversation with Governor Harrison, other conversations,
and M. de Chastellux&#8217;s own careful observations led
him to form opinions about Virginia, then the most influential
of the States, which were correct enough. His analysis
was a forecast. There can be found no better summary of
conditions in Virginia at that time, the statement of a man
of great good sense and a wide experience of men and affairs.
He remarks: &#8220;One must be in the country itself, one must
be acquainted with the language, and take a pleasure in conversing
and in listening, to be qualified to form, and that
slowly, a proper opinion and a decisive judgment. After
this reflection the reader will not be surprised at the pleasure
I took in conversing with Mr. Harrison. He urged me to
dine with him next day, and to pass another day at Richmond.
We set out, however, on the 27th, at 8 in the morning
for Westover. We traveled six and twenty miles without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
halting, in very hot weather, but by a very agreeable road,
with magnificent houses in view at every instant; for the
banks of James River form the garden of Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not by accident,&#8221; observes the Marquis of Chastellux,
writing at Williamsburg, May 1, 1782, &#8220;that I have
postponed the consideration of everything respecting the
progress of the arts and sciences in this country until the
conclusion of my reflections on Virginia; I have done it expressly
because the mind, after bestowing its attention on
the variety of human institutions, reposes itself with pleasure
on those which tend to the perfection of the understanding,
and the progress of information. The College of William
and Mary, whose founders are announced by the very
name, is a noble establishment which embellishes Williamsburg
and does honor to Virginia. I must add that the zeal
of the professors has been crowned with the most distinguished
success, and that they have already formed many
distinguished characters, ready to serve their country in the
various departments of government. After doing justice to
the exertions of the University of Williamsburgh, for such
is the College of William and Mary, if it be necessary for
its farther glory to cite miracles, I shall only observe that
they created me a doctor of laws.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DR. JOHANN DAVID SCHOEPF was born at Weinsiedel
in 1752 and died in the year 1800. He studied
medicine at Hof, Erlangen, Berlin and Vienna, then
traveled in Russia, Italy and Switzerland, and made his degree
in medicine at Erlangen in 1776. That year he came
to America as surgeon to the Hessian troops in the British
army. In 1784 he went to London and traveled through
England and in France, Spain and Italy. He published in
1787 a <i>Materia Medica Americana</i>. Dr. Schoepf was particularly
interested in scientific matters, was an accurate
observer of things and of people, and his book is one of the
best of the early travels in this country. These volumes have
now been translated, and the account given below is a modification.
Dr. Schoepf approached Virginia from the north,
coming through Western Maryland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>&#8220;By this road Leesburg is the first town on the Virginia
side, a place of few houses, small and wooden. On account
of the high, pleasant and healthful situation a Latin school
has been established here. An advertisement of this institution
was to be seen on the tavern door, recommending it in a
handsome style to the public, which should give it patronage,
since schools hitherto, except in the chief cities, are scarce
enough in America. It is not the universal custom in America
to hang shields before the inns, but inns may always be
identified by the great number of papers and notices with
which the walls and doors of these public houses are plastered&mdash;and
the best inns are in general the most papered.
From such announcements the traveler gets a many-sided
entertainment, and gains instruction as to where taxes are
heavy, where wives have eloped or horses been stolen, and
where the new doctor has settled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Along the road from Leesburg towards Fredericksburg
there was not a little difference to be remarked between the
appearance of the country and the thickly settled regions of
Piedmont Maryland and Pennsylvania, through which we
had just passed. It was strange to see so much wild and
newly cleared ground, due not to any unfertility of the soil,
but to the large estates whose owners were unwilling to sell
and found it difficult to secure tenants where there is so much
land to be had almost for the asking. And the contrast in
the appearance of the plantations, after the Potomac is
crossed, is rather striking. In this part of Virginia, as in
lower Maryland, the farmer builds a small village about him.
In some cases, however, all of his buildings would scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
make one comfortable house. From the time of his first
clearing he is continually adding, and his plan may be not
a very good one. We passed Moore&#8217;s Tavern and the Red
House (30 miles from Goose Creek), and skirting the Bull
Run Mountains, approached the strictly tobacco country.
Fairly good tobacco is raised to the west along the foothills,
but the profit is trifling on account of the heavy expense of
carriage to warehouses whence it can be taken off by the European
ships. In this region the crop had been greatly damaged
by an August frost. The loss was the greater because
many of these planters raise only the Sweetscented, a tender
variety, but more profitable by 2&frac12; shillings the hundred, or
25 shillings Virginia currency the hogshead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We spent a night at a plantation where, although no tavern
is kept, the traveler is entertained for pay. There are disadvantages
about this sort of inn, but on the one hand the
proprietor escapes the payment of a liquor license and the
trouble of catering to a crowd of idlers, and on the other
hand the guest must answer only a few times the usual questions
as to where he is going, where he came from, and what
his business is. The captain had a large family, and wished
to sell some of his land, of which he owned 4,000 acres. Land
hereabouts can be bought for from 25 to 50 or 60 shillings
Virginia currency. The captain would sell his for 40 shillings
cash, and with the proceeds move to Kentucky. The
people throughout are bent on providing for their children.
This is difficult to do in the East, and hence the steady emigration
to Kentucky.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>&#8220;Beyond this we got out of the right road, and meeting
only a few darkeys, whose horizon was not extensive, traveled
half a day before we were set right. We passed Cedar Run
at a dangerous ford, and came to a plantation where there is
a copper mine worked intermittently, a narrow vein. Following
the direction, &#8220;keep straight on&#8221; (nobody thinks the
stranger can be quite as ignorant as he says he is), we crossed
Acquia Creek, and reached Fredericksburg. The public
buildings of Fredericksburg&mdash;church, market house and
court house&mdash;we found in bad condition, not because they
had been damaged directly by the war, but simply because
during the war there had been no use made of them. Tobacco
was bringing a small price here, and at a sure profit
to the buyers. No ships were in and taxes were due; the
price had been knocked down to 25 shillings the hundred.
The same at Alexandria. Hunter&#8217;s Iron Works, near Fredericksburg,
at the falls above Falmouth, is one of the finest
and most extensive works of this sort in America. There is
a rolling and a slitting mill, both very ingeniously contrived,
and of this description of iron works there have been up to
this time only one or two established in all America. Under
the British rule such enterprises were forbidden. Past Fredericksburg,
we had the honor to breakfast with an American
general, whose attire was conspicuous&mdash;a large white chapeau,
a blue coat, a brown waistcoat and green breeches decorated
him, and he a short, fat man.</p>

<p>&#8220;From this point on towards Richmond the country is open
and level, and adorned with many large and at times tasteful
dwellings. The rich Virginians do not prefer a town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
life. Here and there we passed large wheat fields. Several
years before the war, owing to the heavy English import duties
on tobacco, the people had begun to raise wheat on a
more extensive scale. Here, as in other parts of America,
the cornfields are seeded to wheat without removing the
stalks. The weevil is bad, especially if the grain lies long in
the straw. After floating off the light seed the good, heavy
grain is broadcasted, mixed with shell lime. Between Fredericksburg
and Richmond we noticed a good many swampy
spots, which might easily be drained. We met on this road,
to our great surprise, two Alsatians traveling along on foot,
with their bundles slung behind. They had come into the
Chesapeake on a French ship, and were seeking their fortune
in Virginia. A foot passenger is a very unusual sight in
Virginia. Passing Hanover Courthouse (December 18,
1783) and Hanover Town, we came to Richmond. On this
road we were struck with the little provision made for the
winter feeding of cattle. How easy it would be to lay down
grass. Near Richmond we saw mules, the first pair. Mules,
being found well adapted to the country, are beginning to
be used a good deal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richmond, before 1779 not a very important town, is
built on two heights, separated by a creek called Shokoes. The
houses are in general of wood, and are irregularly scattered
about. A recent census gives the number as 280, and the
population about 2,000. The falls of the James engaged my
curiosity first. The total fall of the river from Westham to
Richmond (7 miles) is only seventy-one feet, and hence there
is no stupendous cataract. But the falls as a whole, over innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
boulders, between winding wooded banks, present
a great and striking appearance. The sound of the water,
particularly at night, is heard not only through the entire
town, but before the wind for several miles around. At the
falls innumerable herring and shad are caught early in
spring, and at times even in February. These appear in the
Delaware and the Hudson not before the middle of April or
the first of May. James River is one of the greatest and most
beautiful of American streams.</p>

<p>&#8220;During my stay at Richmond the Assembly was in session.
A small frame building serves as House of Assembly, and
with a change of properties as ballroom and banquet room.
The term is used, &#8216;the Assembly sits.&#8217; This does not seem
to me to be precisely descriptive. The members appeared to
me to be anywhere rather than in their seats, and to be discussing
anything except laws to be framed. The doorkeeper
was busy, and in the vestibule there was an uproar. The
vestments of the members are diverse&mdash;boots, trousers, Indian
leggings, great-coats, the usual coat, and short jackets.
In other words, each one wears what he pleases. The members
from the West are greatly inconvenienced in coming so
far. They even speak of establishing a separate government
for the West, as in the province of New York, where there is
a Governor at New York and another at Albany. If this is
done, the West will very likely become in a short time an independent
State. The pay of members has recently been
fixed at 18 Virginia shillings or 3 Spanish dollars per diem.
During the war they preferred tobacco (50 pounds) to currency.
At a vote, the Speaker calls for the Ayes and Noes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and judges with a critical ear which side has made the majority
of sounds. If the predominance is a matter of doubt
a division is called.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped at the Tavern Formicola, which was naturally
much crowded at that season. Every evening there came
generals, colonels, captains, senators, delegates, judges, doctors,
clerks and gentlemen of every weight and calibre to sit
around the fire, drink, smoke, sing and swap anecdotes. Very
entertaining, but Formicola&#8217;s not being a spacious house, I
found the crowd embarrassing. There is only one newspaper
published at Richmond; this paper appears twice a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the south side of James River, opposite Richmond,
lies a little town called Manchester. The rocks in the river
between the two places have been bought up, as well as a
narrow strip along each bank, and the owner proposes to
throw a fine bridge across, which, if built, will be the first
and only one of the kind in America. The project depends
upon whether the Assembly will license this bridge as a toll
bridge. At Manchester I visited Mr. Jacob Rubsamen, a
German, who was before the war engaged in mining in Jersey.
At the outbreak of the war he came to Virginia and set
up a powder mill, the first powder mill to be established in
this country. Rubsamen was able to find saltpetre in the
mountains; his sulphur he brought from Europe, on account
of the heavy expense of getting it out in this country. His
works were not very profitable, and were destroyed in the end
by the British. Mr. Rubsamen told me that lead ore is found
on New River and the Greenbrier, copper on the Roanoke
(Dan), and iron everywhere about, particularly in Buckingham<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
County. Coal was recently discovered twelve miles
from Richmond by the mere chance of the uprooting of a
tree by the wind. This coal brings 1 shilling a bushel (at the
wharf), Virginia currency. Its smell is disagreeable, as I
observed when at Richmond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving Richmond we reached Williamsburg in two days,
passing by Warwick (where the British had destroyed a considerable
plant for the working of iron), Osborne&#8217;s, a pleasant
place, though small, and Petersburg, a town of a thriving
trade and larger than Richmond. Cotton is raised in this
region on good new land or on heavily fertilized land, and
the favorite tobaccos are the Sweetscented, the Long Green,
the Varina, the Frederick, the Oroonoko, the Hudson, Thickjoint,
Thickset, Shoestring and other varieties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Williamsburg is to be counted among the most beautiful
of American cities. The Capitol, or Statehouse, closes one
end of the High Street, a large and modern building. Because
no better use can be made of it now, a Latin school is
to be established where the government was once installed.
Doctors in all the faculties are graduated at the College of
William and Mary. Most of the students, however, complete
their studies at the English and Scottish universities. The
citizens of this town, as of all lower Virginia, greatly hope
that the seat of government will be brought back to Williamsburg.
At the tavern I found very good entertainment and
paid high for it. The black attendants, neatly and modishly
attired, make their bows with dignity and respectfulness.
They spoke with enthusiasm of the politeness of the French
officers lately quartered there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>&#8220;We made an excursion to Yorktown, called also Little
York, to see that famous place, and particularly to inspect
the great oyster banks there. The inhabitants have not yet
recovered from the disturbances of war, and many houses
are still in ruins or half repaired. The spars of the ships
sunk in the river to block the passage are yet to be seen. We
returned the same day to Williamsburg, to set out the next
morning for the South. Seven miles from Williamsburg, on
the Southern road, we came to James River, and after much
delay were obliged to turn back to Williamsburg because of
an unfavorable wind at the ferry. The next day at sunrise,
when the wind is generally still, we came again to the ferry
and were put across, but not without delay. Lord Cornwallis
was the excuse. They said he had ruined the wharf, and the
tide was not yet high enough to take off men and horses from
the bank, which is there low.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not far below the ferry lies James Island, formerly only
a peninsula; in a fierce storm with high water the river broke
through the slender tongue of land. Jamestown appears in
several modern geographies as a place of eighty to a hundred
houses. In reality there are there but one or two, and they
ruinous. The most valuable land in this region is that along
the rivers and creeks, not so much from the superior fertility,
as because of the accessibility to water transportation. Such
land sells at four, five or six pounds, Virginia. If the corn
crop fails the planter is in straits, and if the price of tobacco
is high everything else&mdash;bacon, corn, etc.&mdash;is high in proportion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Desiring gain, and spending his time on tobacco, the
planter loses through not giving attention to those articles of
necessity which he might produce at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five miles from James River we came to Surry Courthouse,
where there was a crowd, because it was court day.
Eleven miles farther on we passed Nelson&#8217;s Ordinary, and
after ten miles more reached Smithfield, or Isle of Wight
Courthouse. The road from Williamsburg is mainly through
woods, but we passed more churches (five, that is to say)
than during any other day&#8217;s journey in America.</p>

<p>&#8220;Towards Smithfield the traveler passes beyond the tobacco
country. The chief exports here are tar, pitch, turpentine
and salted meat. A barrel of tar, thirty-one and one-half
gallons, costs from 8 to 9 Virginia shillings; a barrel of turpentine
18 shillings, and a barrel of salted pork (220
pounds) 50 shillings. At Smithfield we spent the evening
with a party of gentlemen from the neighborhood. The conversation
was for the most part on the subject of Virginia,
what advantages that State has over every other State in the
world, and how the nation of Virginia is superior to every
other nation&mdash;in resources, manners, purity of speech and in
all respects.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stranger notes deficiencies. For instance, a gentleman
of Petersburg remarked to me that he thought of sending
his son to Edinburgh to make a doctor of him, since he
would probably not marry and set up as a planter, being now past
the age of twenty-one. But it must be admitted that physically,
the Virginians are a comely race, and they show on all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
subjects clear and strong understandings. It is to be regretted
that they do not give more attention to the exact sciences.
They read, but they do not study.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christmas Eve we came to Everett&#8217;s Bridge, and the next
day to Suffolk, on another arm of Nansemond Creek. In
the month of May, 1779, a great part of Suffolk was burned
by the British. There are no stones at this place, and the
deep, fine sand of the streets is an inconvenience. Before the
houses they lay a sort of pavement, pitch and tar mixed with
the sand and allowed to harden. They drive a trade from
this place to the West Indies in small vessels, shallops of
twenty to fifty tons burthen. Salt is an especial article of
their traffic. When the vessels, which bring it from Tortola,
Turk&#8217;s Island and other of the West Indies, are delayed, the
price of salt is tripled and quadrupled. During the war the
people were greatly in want of salt, and the attempt was made
to get it from the sea by damming the water in ponds along
the coast. Little success attended this experiment south of
the thirty-seventh parallel, probably because of the frequent
rain-storms which freshened the ponded sea water.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Suffolk to Cunningham&#8217;s we skirted the great Dismal
Swamp. Along the road from York, in Virginia, to this
point it is observable that the south bank of all the rivers and
creeks is steeper and rougher than the north bank. This may
be due to the weathering of the north and northeast storms.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the diary of George Washington for the year 1785 appear
these entries: &#8220;Sunday, December 25.&mdash;Count Castiglioni
came here to dinner. December 29.&mdash;Count
Castiglioni went away after breakfast on his tour to the
southward.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Count Luigi Castiglioni, who had landed at
Boston in May, and after going through New England and
a part of Canada, had come to New York, whence, on the
27th of November, he had set out for the South, reaching
Alexandria December 24th, and spending Christmas at
Mount Vernon. Count Castiglioni was a man of science,
Chevalier of the Order of St. Stephen, P. M., member of the
Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and also member of
the Patriotical Society of Milan, Patrician of Milan. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
book written by him, <i>Viaggio negli Stati Uniti</i>, is particularly
descriptive of the useful plants to be found in this
country, with a view to their introduction into Europe, either
for the farm and the kitchen garden or for practical inclusion
in the <i>materia medica</i>. This book and that of Dr.
Schoepf, 1783-1784, give an excellent statement as to the
natural history, the methods of agriculture, milling, mining,
etc., of that period in the history of the fourteen States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexandria,&#8221; says Count Castiglioni, &#8220;numbers 300
houses and possibly 3,000 inhabitants. At times, although
the latitude is only 38 degrees 45 minutes, the cold is so great
that the Potowmack may be ridden and driven over. Such
freezing weather is never of long duration, and many winters
the river is not frozen at all. This newly established town
has already received the name and the privileges of a city,
and as soon as the Potowmack is made navigable will become
one of the most flourishing of the trading towns of Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was there the plan for the improvement of the
navigation (suggested by General Washington) was beginning
to be put into effect. Near Alexandria brick and tiles
are made at a reasonable price, the soil thereabouts being a
soft, viscous clay. They make lime there from the oyster
shells, which are found in extraordinary banks. The people
have two theories about these great shell banks, one being
that they are due to successive inundations of the sea, the
other that the aborigines assembled them, either for burial
mounds or for some other religious purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning of the 25th of December I left Alexandria
and went to Mount Vernon. There I spent four memorable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
days. General Washington is perhaps fifty-seven years of
age, a man large and strong of build, of a majestic but kindly
bearing, and, notwithstanding the fatigues of war, appears
not yet to be aging. This celebrated man, who began and so
happily carried through the American war, seems, as it were,
to have been formed by nature to free this country of European
rule and to inaugurate an epoch in the history of mankind.
Bred to arms, he has not neglected the study of politics,
and there is probably no one in America who has a better
knowledge of the present condition of the United States
or more sincerely desires their welfare. May Heaven spare
him many years for the good of his country, for an example
to it and to Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving Mount Vernon December 29th, in the morning,
I went by Colchester, a little place on the River Ochoquan,
Dumfries, where there are several warehouses for tobacco;
Aquaja (only a few houses), and fourteen miles beyond came
to Falmouth, on the Rappahannock, whence it is the custom
to ferry down to Fredericksburg, on the opposite bank. Fredericksburg,
like Alexandria, is by law styled a city, and carries
on a heavy trade in tobacco. From Fredericksburg
many plantations are seen, larger and smaller. The large
houses are generally built with a porch, and the outbuildings
ranged at either side. The tobacco exhausts a cleared field
in three years, and no attempt is made to manure, the cattle
being kept at large in the woods. Two acres in tobacco bring
about two hogsheads, or maybe 3,000 pounds. One thousand
pounds (a hogshead) fetches from 27 to 39 shillings Virginia
money the hundred.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>&#8220;The following day I traveled thirty miles through a district
where much tobacco is raised, and much peach brandy
and persimmon beer is made. The peach flourishes so in
Virginia that often when a tract of land is cleared the peach
trees take possession of the whole area, nothing being done
for the propagation of them except letting in the sun on the
ground. The persimmon is gathered from a sort of Guayakana
in the woods. The fruit would be very good to eat but
for the skin, which has an unpleasantness in the taste. In
the evening I came to Richmond, now the capital of Virginia,
a town which has grown rapidly, and numbers some 4,000
inhabitants, and 400 houses. The town is built on two hills,
separated by a brook, over which is thrown a wooden bridge,
with side ways for foot passengers. The trade of the place
consists largely in tobacco, and there is much competition
from the other markets at Alexandria and Petersburg. When
I was there a well had just been dug to the depth of seventy
feet on one of the hills, which rise one above another from
the James, here a river foaming among great rocks. I visited
the spot. The earth removed smelled of sulphur, and
had the look of rotted wood, ash gray, but turning white on
exposure to the air. There were found at the bottom of this
well, bedded in the earth described, many bones, some larger
than the bones of cattle, and also remains of the aboriginal
Indians, stone implements, etc., proof that these tribes had
been in possession of the land many centuries before.</p>

<p>&#8220;January 6th [1786] I passed on to Petersburg, through
Osborne&#8217;s. Blandford, Pocahontas and Petersburg are now
incorporated under the name Petersburg. Great quantity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of tobacco is brought to Petersburg, even from the North
Carolina country, and is there exported to Europe as James
River tobacco, which is the best sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mile from the town lives Colonel Banister, a nephew<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
of the famous John Banister, who gave up his place as professor
of botany and librarian at the University of Oxford,
and settling in this part of Virginia, at great pains and with
rare judgment collected and described a number of the scarcest
plants. From Colonel Banister&#8217;s I went, on the 9th, to
Kingston, a rich plantation belonging to Captain Walker, in
the county of Dinwiddie. The following day I visited Dr.
Greenway, by birth an Englishman, and an amateur of botany.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
I examined his collection with true pleasure, and the
next day came again, since Dr. Greenway had given me leave
to transscribe from his notes; I have included this material
in my descriptions of American plants, relative to the medicinal
practices of the aborigines. Five miles from Kingston
the traveler passes the River Nottoway. The few Indians
remaining of the tribe of that name live near Southampton
Courthouse, forty miles distant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having come from Kingston along this road, by the Nottoway
and Hiksford (a wooden bridge leads over the Meherrin),
thirteen miles beyond the Meherrin, I entered the
State of North Carolina on the parallel thirty-six degrees
thirty minutes. In this and other parts of Virginia, as also
in both the Carolinas, there is found a very noxious serpent
called by the inhabitants the Moquisson.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8220;Returning from Georgia and the Carolinas, after I had
passed the River Dan [May 11, 1786] three miles from the
North Carolina line, I came to the plantation of Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;.
In the evening prayers were read, but after the first verse the
announcement was made that it was bed time, and we had
better disperse. The next day I reached Colonel Coles&#8217;s,
having come forty miles through Paintonborough
and by a bridge over Banister River. I had met Colonel
Coles at Richmond, and was received by him with great
cordiality. When he heard that I was on my way to Philadelphia
he gave me a letter to his brother, Colonel John
Coles, who has a place on that road, near Charlottesville. I
examined with pleasure, at Colonel Coles&#8217;s (on Staunton
River) several artificial meadows of clover and rye grass, or
wild rye, and also the Colonel&#8217;s stud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crossed the Staunton in a boat the morning of the 14th.
Here I left the main road and traveled twenty miles through
a rough country. The next day, after passing Johns&#8217; Ordinary,
I came to Buckingham Courthouse, situated on a high
hill, at the foot of which runs the Appomattox.</p>

<p>&#8220;I spent the night at Mr. Patteson&#8217;s, who has a fine plantation
near, and the following day reached James River,
twenty miles beyond. A mile from the river a high wind
began to blow and the sky was suddenly covered with black
clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunder and lightning followed, and the rain and hail
came down in streams. The horses were frightened and
would not go on. When we reached the bank the storm had
almost passed. We called to the ferryman, who was standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
in his door on the other side, but he moved not a foot until
the rain had entirely ceased, and then gave as excuse that he
had not seen us. While we were waiting a large serpent
came out of the river onto the banks. I killed it, and found
it to be not unlike what they call in Lombardy the smiroldo.
On the other side of the river, in a group of houses, stands
the building in which the court of Albemarle County was
formerly held. I dried my clothes here, ate dinner, and kept
on four miles to Eniscotty, the residence of Colonel John
Coles, who received me hospitably as his brother. The situation,
at the top of a hill, is such that the leaves fall later
there, and appear earlier in the spring, than in the country
adjacent. The calicanthus grows well, with such an exposure;
the hill is called in the neighborhood the Green Hill,
which, indeed, in situation and fertility may be compared
with the foothills of Monte di Brianza. The mulberry and
the vine should flourish here.</p>

<p>&#8220;May 18th I left Eniscotty. I crossed the Blue Ridge by
the road through Rockfish Gap, which is not comparable,
either in steepness or in length, to the roads over the Apennines,
much less those over the Alps. Thick fog, followed
by rain, compelled me to spend the day at a house on the
divide, the proprietor of which told me much regarding the
fertility of the lands in that region and the customs of the
inhabitants. He informed me that many people from the
lower country stayed at his house on their way to the springs
in the Alleghany Mountains. Having crossed the Blue
Mountains and the South River, I came to Stantown the
morning of the 23d. Here I was enabled to see a mocking-bird.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
These birds are often kept in cages, and are bought
by the English at extravagant prices. They are very scarce
to the north, and have many times fetched three to four
guineas at Boston. About Stantown tobacco is only beginning
to be cultivated. They raise wheat, Turkish corn [Indian
corn] and hemp. Heavy rains kept me at Stantown
until the 27th, and prevented me seeing the extraordinary
Natural Bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Middle River, a small stream usually fordable the
year through, I found several travelers waiting for an opportunity
to cross. I put up at a house nearby, and as often
as the rain permitted went out, like the Egyptians, to measure
with a rod the rise or fall of the waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning of the 29th the good man of the house advised
me that I might now cross. A crowd of people were
at the bank to see us make the attempt. My servant stripped
himself and ventured in (on horseback) with the carriage.
He had hardly left the bank when the force of the stream
swept him down and overturned the calesche. I called to him
from where I was standing that his only hope was to let the
horse go, and swim; he kept by the horse, and managed to
save both it and himself. I resolved never again, in the matter
of ferrying a swollen stream, to trust to the advice of these
wild pioneers. The next morning I was able to cross, and at
the North River was taken over in a flat canoe, the horses
swimming at the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The following day, having passed Smith Creek, a dangerous
stream, I came into a new road, full of roots and bad
from the rain besides. The wheels of the calesche, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
had already been many times repaired, broke into a hundred
pieces, and at the first smithy I determined to abandon the
vehicle and continue the journey on horseback. Beyond the
Shenadore, which we crossed in a canoe, the horses swimming
behind, we fell into a marshy and rocky road, which
leads over Mill Creek and Stony Creek. Keeping on, through
a country of many delightful prospects, between the Blue
and the Alleghany Mountains, we passed through Millerstown,
the county seat of the county of Shenadore, Stowerstown,
Newtown, and arrived at Winchester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winchester, for commerce, is one of the most important
towns of Virginia. The number of the houses is about 200.
The traffic is in wheat, flour and hemp, sold at Baltimore and
Philadelphia, whence European manufactures are brought
and expedited further beyond the mountains. The water at
Winchester&mdash;limestone&mdash;has a strong effect on first being
used. The 18th of June I left Winchester and spent that
night at Weathers-don-Marsh, called also Charletown, and
from there, on the following day, passed the Blue Ridge for
the second time at Harper&#8217;s Ferry.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT would be an interesting book that should give the history
of missions in this country. That godly man, Nicholas
Ferrar, who was so active in the affairs of the London
Company; the good minister of Jamestown, who came
with the first supply; the pastors of the congregations that
settled in Massachusetts; the Jesuit fathers; the emissaries
of the Society of Friends; the Presbyterians from the north
of Ireland and from Scotland; Whitefield, Asbury, Coke&mdash;how
large was the share of these men in the making of America.
Among them, Dr. Thomas Coke was not the least. He
was nine times in this country and covered a great part of it
as then known, including the islands of the British and several
of the French Indies.</p>

<p>Dr. Coke was born in 1747, and was graduated B. A. at
Oxford in 1768. In 1775 he was made D. C. L., and had
considerable prospects of church preferment, but was reckoned
a Methodist after 1776. His bishop reproved him, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
declined to remove him. His rector dismissed him. Wesley
employed him for a time to assist in answering his voluminous
correspondence. In 1782 he was the first president of
the Irish Conference, and held the office for the rest of his
life, with a few intermissions. In 1784 he drew up a plan
for missions, and was appointed superintendent, with episcopal
functions, in America. That year he came to this
country and ordained Asbury, at Baltimore, as deacon, elder
and superintendent. Wesley was very indignant at the
change of the title superintendent to bishop, and the confirmation
of the change led in 1792 to the O&#8217;Kellyan schism.
Dr. Coke possessed a private fortune of &pound;1,200 a year. He
died in 1813 on a voyage to India. His work in the field
of missions was cosmopolitan, and to him more than to any
other the creation of the vast network of the Methodist foreign
missions is due.</p>

<p>September, 1784, Dr. Coke sailed from King Road, Bristol,
for New York. In November he was on the Eastern
Shore. Returning to Philadelphia and Baltimore, he was
at Alexandria March 9, 1785. This great man was able to
enjoy the country. He was born in Wales. But he does not
seem to have been skilled in the art of cross-country horsemanship
in all weathers. He writes (March 9th): &#8220;In my
ride this morning to Alexandria through the woods, I have
had one of the most romantic scenes that ever I beheld. Yesterday
there was a very heavy fall of snow and hail and
sleet. The fall of sleet was so great that the trees seemed to
be trees of ice. So beautiful a sight of the kind I never
saw before.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>There was no one to pilot Dr. Coke from Alexandria, and
his servant had overstayed his time on a visit to the Eastern
Shore. Between Alexandria and Colchester there were two
runs to be crossed, both greatly swollen from the sudden
thaw. &#8220;A friend who lives in Alexandria came with me
over the first run, and everybody informed me I could easily
cross the second if I crossed the first. When I came to the
second (which was perhaps two hours after I crossed the
first) I found that I had two streams to pass. The first I
went over without much danger; but in crossing the second,
which was very strong and very deep, I did not observe that
a tree, brought down by the flood, lay across the landing
place. I endeavored, but in vain, to drive my horse against
the stream and go around the tree. I was afraid to turn my
horse&#8217;s head to the stream and afraid to go back. In this
dilemma I thought it most prudent for me to lay hold on
the tree, and go over it, the water being shallow on the other
side. No sooner did I execute my purpose so far as to lay
hold of the tree (and that instant the horse was carried from
under me) but the motion that I gave it loosened it, and
down the stream it instantly carried me.&#8221; The tree, with
passenger, lodged below at a little island, and then there
floated down another tree. The doctor, besides being thoroughly
wetted, was near losing his life. After more than a
hundred years the suggestion may be offered that the first
tree should never have been laid hold of. &#8220;I was now obliged
to walk,&#8221; continues Dr. Coke, &#8220;about a mile, shivering, before
I came to a house. The master and mistress were from
home, and were not expected to return that night. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
principal negro lent me an old ragged shirt, coat, waistcoat,
breeches, etc., and the negroes made a large fire and hung
my clothes up to dry all night.&#8221; Before bedtime the horse,
having got around the tree, was recovered and brought in by
a neighbor, who supposed the rider to be drowned. &#8220;As he
seemed to be a poor man, I gave him half a guinea. I trust
I shall never forget so awful but very instructive a scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this March welcome to Virginia, Dr. Coke passed
through the State into North Carolina, and returned to Alexandria
May 23d. He was at Fredericksburg and Williamsburg
(where inquiring for a Methodist he was told there was
one in the town, who proved to be &#8220;a good old Presbyterian&#8221;
and hospitable), at Smithfield and Portsmouth, in Mecklenburg
County, at New Glasgow, towards the mountains, and
in Culpeper County. These sojournings are specified. There
was a bad season in May that year, and near Alexandria the
creeks were again difficult at the crossings. It was observed
on this, the first tour, that in Mecklenburg County &#8220;they
have a great variety of fruit pies&mdash;peach, apple, pear and
cranberry, and puddings&mdash;very often.&#8221; About New Glasgow
(on Buffalo River, just north of Amherst Courthouse)
Dr. Coke remarks: &#8220;The wolves, I find, frequently come to
the fences at night, howling in an awful manner; and sometimes
they seize upon a straying sheep. At a distance was
the Blue Ridge, an amazing chain of mountains. I prefer
this country to any other part of America&mdash;it is so like
Wales, my native country. And it is far more populous
than I expected.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>In April, 1787, Dr. Coke was a second time in Virginia,
scarcely a fortnight. He had come from England to the
Island of Antigua, and sailed from St. Eustatia in a large
Dutch ship, February 10th, for Charleston. &#8220;In the course
of our journey through North Carolina I preached at the
house of a gentleman near Salisbury, who was formerly a
dancing-master, and has amassed a considerable fortune,
with which he has purchased a large estate. In traveling
through Virginia our rides were so long that we were frequently
on horseback till midnight after preaching in the
middle of the day. Since I left Charleston I have got into
my old romantic way of life, of preaching in the midst of
great forests, with scores and sometimes hundreds of horses
tied to the trees, which adds much solemnity to the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the course of my journey through this State I visited
the county of Halifax, where I met with a little persecution
on my former visit. I am now informed that soon after I
left the county on my former tour a bill was presented against
me as a seditious person before the grand jury, and was
found by the jury, and ninety persons had engaged to pursue
me and bring me back again. Another bill was also presented
in one of the neighboring counties, but was thrown
out. Many of the people, I find, imagined that I would not
venture amongst them again. However, when I came they
all received me with perfect peace and quietness. Indeed, I
now acknowledge that however just my sentiments may be
concerning slavery, it was ill-judged of me to deliver them
from the pulpit. Many of the inhabitants at Richmond, I
was informed, said that I would not dare to venture into that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
town. But they did not know me, for I am a plain, blunt
man, that goes directly on. However, instead of opposition,
the Governor of the State, who resides there, ordered the
Capitol to be opened to me, and a very respectable and very
attentive congregation I was favored with.&#8221; On the way
from Richmond to Alexandria there was a plot laid for Dr.
Coke by a company of agreeable men at one of the inns. &#8220;In
the first dish of tea there was a little rum; in the second a
little more, but the third was so strong that on our complaining
of a conspiracy, it seemed as if the rum had sprung into
our tea of itself, for both company and waiters solemnly protested
they were innocent. On the last day of April Mr.
Asbury and I arrived at Baltimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following year, 1788 (the Atlantic seems to have been
but a ferry even then), Dr. Coke was in Virginia again for
a few days, coming, as in 1787, from the West Indies by
Charleston. &#8220;In traveling from North Carolina to Virginia
we were favored with one of the most beautiful prospects I
ever beheld. The country, as far as we could see from the
top of a hill, was ornamented with a great number of peach
orchards, the peach trees being all in full bloom, and displaying
a diversity of most beautiful colors&mdash;blue, purple and
violet. On the opposite side of a beautiful vale which lay
at the foot of a hill, ran the River Yeadkin, reflecting the
rays of the sun from its broad, placid stream; and the mountains
which bounded the view formed a very fine background
for the completing of the prospect. The two days following
we rode on the ridge of a long hill, with a large vale on each
side, and mountains rising above mountains for twenty, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
sometimes, I suppose, for forty miles on each hand. In Halifax
County, Virginia, where I met with much persecution
four years ago, almost all the great people of the county came
in their chariots and other carriages to hear me, and behaved
with great propriety: there were not less than five colonels
in the congregation. On the 18th of April we opened our
first Virginia Conference for the State of Virginia in the
town of Petersburgh. From Petersburgh we set off for our
second Virginia Conference, which we held in the town of
Leesburgh, visiting Richmond by the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Coke&#8217;s fourth and last journey in Virginia (the last,
that is, recorded in his book, published 1793) was again in
April, year 1791. As in 1787 and 1788, the approach
was from the south. &#8220;On Monday, the 11th of April, we
arrived at Dickes&#8217;s Ferry, in Virginia. Our ride on that day
was remarkably pleasing. The variety arising from the intermixture
of woods and plantations along the sides of the
broad, rocky river Dan, near which we rode most part of the
time, could not but be a source of great pleasure to an admirer
of the beauties of nature. Hitherto (April 15th) I
might be said to have traveled with the spring. As I moved
from South to North the spring was, I think, as far advanced
when I was in Georgia as when I came into Virginia. But
now it has evidently got the start of me. The oaks have
spread out their leaves, and the dogwood, whose bark is very
medicinal, and whose innumerable white flowers form one of
the finest ornaments of the forest, is in full bloom. The deep
green of the pines, the bright transparent green of the oaks,
and the fine white of the flowers of the dogwood, with other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
trees and shrubs, form such a complication of beauties as are
indescribable to those who have only lived in countries that
are almost entirely cultivated.</p>

<p>&#8220;For about 800 miles which I have rode since I landed in
South Carolina, we have had hardly any rain. But this day,
the 16th, we were wetted to the skin. However, we at last
happily found our way to the house of a friend by the preachers&#8217;
mark&mdash;the split bush.&#8221; This circumstance may appear
to many immaterial; however, as it may convey some idea
of the mode in which the preachers are obliged to travel in
this country, I will just enlarge upon it. The method was
to split two or three bushes, at the junction of several roads,
along the road that should be followed; very useful to the
itinerant at the formation of new circuits in the forest. Dr.
Coke observes: &#8220;In one of the circuits the wicked discovered
the secret, and split bushes in wrong places on purpose to
deceive the preachers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The character of this great man appears in his book, written
without artifice. The people were glad to see him. &#8220;On
the 20th of April we opened our conference at Petersburgh.
April 24th I preached in Richmond, in the Capitol where the
Assembly sits, to the most dressy congregation I ever saw in
America. However, they gave great attention. In the afternoon
I rode to Colonel Clayton&#8217;s, about twenty-five miles
from Richmond. April 20th I came among the cedar trees.
This evening we arrived at Port Royal, where a numerous
and very dressy congregation had been waiting for us about
two hours with wonderful patience. A gentleman of the
name of Hipkins, a capital merchant of the town, sent us a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
genteel invitation to sup with him, and lodge at his house. I
accepted of it. Soon after I came in he observed that the
Philadelphia paper had informed the public of the death of
Mr. Wesley.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> I gave no credit to the account, but, however,
intreated the favour of seeing the paper. He sent immediately
to a neighboring merchant who took in that paper, and
about 10 o&#8217;clock the melancholy record arrived. I evidently
saw by the account that it was too true.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning I set off for New York, in order to be
in time for the British packet. At Alexandria the news was
confirmed by a letter from London. On the 29th I crossed
the run of water called Akatenke, down which I was carried
by the flood. We were now come into a country abounding
with singing birds. But alas! I could take no pleasure in
them, the death of my venerable friend had cast such a shade
of melancholy over my heart. The night being very dark, it
was with great difficulty that my friend, who traveled with
me, and myself found our way from Alexandria to Blaidensburg.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>A SUMMER AT BATH.</i></p>

<p class="ph1"><i>1791.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p><i>Captain Bayard, of the Artillery&mdash;From Baltimore
to Bath&mdash;Bath described&mdash;Tea at Bath&mdash;Irish
Comedians&mdash;Valley Lands&mdash;Winchester&mdash;Colonel
P.&mdash;The Sabbath in America&mdash;Land Merchants.</i></p></div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the year VI (1798) there was published at Paris a book
written by a retired captain of artillery, Ferdinand Marie
Bayard, described on the title page, &#8220;A Journey Into the
Interior of the United States, to Bath, Winchester, the Shenandoah
Valley, etc., etc., During the Summer of 1791.&#8221; It
is strange that this book has not been translated. It is interesting
as a sort of sentimental journey of a very intelligent
man (member of the Society of Sciences Letters and Arts at
Paris), who visited a spot not often mentioned by the early
traveler in this country. Captain Bayard was born at Moulins
la Marche in 1768, and was living in 1836. He was in
his twenty-third year the summer of 1791. He had already
retired from the army and become a traveler in various parts
of the world.</p>

<p>Captain Bayard seems to have landed at Baltimore, with
his wife and small boy. He remarks, &#8220;The months of June,
July and August are bad for children if kept in town in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
country. Bath, situated 120 miles from Baltimore, and near
the Valley of the Shenandoah, offered a stopping place in the
country and a point of departure from which to visit that fertile
region, where, beneath skies almost always serene, the inhabitants
cultivate a generous soil, which rewards liberally
the slightest efforts of human industry. I wished to see this
promised land, from the bosom of which an innumerable population
is beginning to arise, prosperous and content, and
already passing the limits of the Valley to occupy the vast
spaces beyond. Besides, before returning home, I desired to
gain a knowledge of the American people, and this I could
better compass in the country than in the towns. For the trip
I hired a carriage at Baltimore, at 41 francs the passenger,
baggage included. The owner was the driver, and a very
skilful one, as we learned on the road, which is often abominable
and extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four miles south of the Potomac [by way of Ellicott&#8217;s
Lower Mill, Ellicott&#8217;s Upper Mill, the Red House, the Monocacy
River, Fredericktown, and Middletown] we arrived at
Bath, in Virginia. The town is situated in a triangular and
very narrow gorge. The mountain to the west is high and
steep, and in the month of March snow and earth become
loosened from the declivity and descend in avalanches. The
houses built next to this dangerous mountain are protected
by heavy palisades. Several people, having neglected the precaution,
have had their houses engulfed. The residents boast
of the climate&mdash;the winter not too cold, and the heat of summer
moderate. Bath has two public buildings&mdash;the theatre
and the bathhouse. The first is a log edifice, and the second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
a framed barrack, partitioned into eight cells, in each of
which there are steps arranged for the convenience of the
bathers. The spring is hard by. The water is dispensed in
a goblet by the man in charge. The water is clear, lukewarm,
and insipid, but very efficacious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen many come to Bath fearfully rheumatic, who
had to be carried to the spring at first, and in three weeks
were able to walk with a crutch. Bath was formerly called
Warm Springs. The name was changed in deference to the
English resort. This imitative mania is a bad symptom, and
augurs ill for that nation, whose name is dear to lovers of
liberty everywhere. At Bath the young women ride about a
great deal, and are excellent horsewomen. It is to be remarked
that their physiognomy is distinct among American
women. During the fall, boats come up the river from Alexandria
and Georgetown, and return laden with grain. After
that season there is no more traffic by water until the spring,
and if any one has neglected to provide himself he must make
a trip to Winchester for supplies, thirty-nine miles off. The
inhabitants of this region are very fond of the English boxing
match. Generally a bruiser (breaker of bones) is in
charge of these combats, who sees to the strict carrying out
of all the regulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;At our boarding house (excellent fare) there were about
forty people, among them two Virginians&mdash;Madame B. and
Madame A.&mdash;who spoke French tolerably well. Madame B.
had read the works of Swedenborg, and entertained us with
descriptions drawn from those mystical books. There were
several very pious people at our boarding house, one of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
had a theory that eating was not to satisfy the appetite. I
noticed that he ate a great deal. At Bath it is the custom to
drink tea at 5 o&#8217;clock. Everything is very ceremonious. At
the right of the lady dispensing tea are ranged in a half circle
all the other ladies. A profound silence follows the entrance
of each invited guest; all the ladies as grave as judges
on the bench. A small acajou table is placed before the dispenser
of tea. Silver pots contain the coffee and the hot
water, which serves to weaken the tea or to receive the cups.
A domestic brings on a silver waiter the cup, the sugar dish,
the cream pot, the butter balls, the thin slices of ham. A
Frenchman is embarrassed at the necessity of watching his
cup and saucer in one hand, and with the other receiving a
tart or a slice of very thin ham.</p>

<p>&#8220;In sending back the cup the spoon must be placed in a
manner to indicate whether you will begin again, or have finished
drinking. A Frenchman on one occasion, unfamiliar
with English and ignorant of this polite sign language, was
overcome at seeing the sixteenth cup arrive, which, having
emptied, he hit upon the device of stowing it in his pocket,
dreading a seventeenth. The tea dispensed and consumed,
there are songs. Mademoiselle L. was the accomplished artist
at Bath. Her favorite song was one of a certain Patrick,
who, absent, was still to be remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had at Bath a troupe of Irish comedians, alternately
emperors, shepherds, clowns, and no doubt very badly fed.
The young man who played the lover found great difficulty
in pronouncing his consonants. A tall, thin man played the
tragic role of enamored prince. A blonde soubrette was solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
coquettish. The others of the troupe are scarcely to
be recalled. We had tragedy, comedy, comic opera, and farce.
Every week there was a dance. Billiards was an amusement,
and there was play at the taverns, particularly after the arrival
of a gentleman who kept a Pharaoh bank. He was
treated with great courtesy, and I heard nothing said against
his probity. Nevertheless, it happens that the planter who
arrives at Bath with equipage and attendants goes home with
nothing but a horse, and a very mean horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hired a horse to go to Winchester. For more than half
of the way the country is wild. As you draw nearer the town
in the Valley, many well-stocked farms appear, the land being
very fertile. On the slope there range strong, long-wooled
sheep, not afraid of wolves during the summer. Such war
is made upon the wolves that even in this heavily timbered
country there is little danger from them except when the snow
lies deep upon the ground. It is a magnificent country about
Winchester. The men are tall, well-made, of strong constitutions,
and ruddy. The horses and cattle have the eye and
the gait of health. I stopped at a tavern kept by a German,
who has made a fortune in the business. I was treated with
consideration, for having lived at Strasbourg and for having
crossed the Rhine. At this tavern there is a good cook, the
meat is excellent, there is game and fresh-water fish; the
house is well furnished, wines of every country, good linen,
good beds, the rooms well lighted, and the whole at a reasonable
price. The day after I arrived there came to the tavern
an old gentleman limping from the gout. I mentioned
Thomas Payne to him and the &#8216;Rights of Man.&#8217; He fixed me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
with his eye, out the air with his stick, and said vehemently
that he wished Thomas Payne was hanged. He left me, and
at the same time I got up, whistling the air of &#8216;Ca Ira.&#8217; I
learned the cause of his behavior: he had held a lucrative
office before the war, and was an incurable Tory.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Mr. Smith, who lives a mile from Winchester, asked
me to dine. I spent the time very agreeably there. From the
liberality of his opinions I was led to discuss the political situation
of America with considerable frankness. Mr. Smith
and his brother-in-law accompanied me back to Winchester,
discoursing by the way of their fortunate lot, of the progress
of agriculture, and of the richness of the inexhaustible soil,
which yields an abundance to the inhabitants of this beautiful
Valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a letter of introduction to Colonel P., formerly aid
de camp to General Washington. Colonel P. lives some sixteen
miles from Winchester, greatly esteemed for his public
and private virtues. On the way to his house I passed through
a country of abundant harvests, fat pastures and well peopled;
where there was forest the trees were of a magnificent
growth, and in the intervals a deep green turf invited the
traveler to repose. It was hot. I dismounted beneath a poplar
tree, the white flower of which offered its corolla to the
bee and the humming bird. The coolness of the place, the
delicious perfumes exhaled by the acacias, the ivy, and the
flowers springing from the sod, all gave to the senses that
calm which is the precursor of sleep; but ideas of the happiness
prepared for generations to come in this land of peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and plenty, thoughts of the future greatness of the American
people, supplied a reverie sweeter than that of dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not far from the house of Colonel P., I met a large man
on horseback, whose open countenance was an invitation to
talk. He was dressed like a farmer during the busy season.
I asked him the way. He showed me the road, and continued
his path without adding a word to the precise answer he had
given me. Arrived at the house, I found the overseer near
the barn directing some negroes who were shelling corn. I
had not been long in the house, a structure of logs, and very
comfortable, when there entered the same man I had met in
the road, none other than Colonel P. himself. I presented
my letter, which he quickly read, and receiving me in the
most friendly manner, offered me refreshments. We talked
of the war, and he sketched for me in brief its causes. At
dinner I drank old whiskey distilled on the place. The Colonel
spoke with pleasure of his farm operations: he makes
everything at home. He showed me the plan of his 1,000
acres, at the centre of which he will build a large and commodious
house. At the present time his outbuildings are more
carefully constructed than his mansion. I quitted Colonel
P. at sunset, much pleased with him, and grateful for his
kind attentions.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> Shortly after, the moon appeared over the
mountains to the south, and cast a light over the valley. The
whippoorwill commenced its plaints, almost extinguished by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the various song of the melodious mocking-bird. The blacks
were coming in from the fields singing behind the slow horses
fatigued with the day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next day at Winchester I went to church, a frame
building, and hitched around it horses of price well caparisoned.
The negroes sat in the gallery, dressed in their Sunday
clothes. Below were their masters and mistresses, whose
appearance proclaimed them alive to the sanctity of the place
and to the solemnity of the ceremony.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minister, a Presbyterian, was the grandson of a
Frenchman. Coming back from church I observed that the
doors of all the houses were closed. They remained so
throughout the day. Mrs. B. and her daughters retired after
dinner to read chapters of the Old and the New Testament.
Throughout the United States this is the manner of observing
Sunday.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Valley of the Shenandoah is a most prosperous and
healthful region. Tobacco, corn, flax and wheat are the principal
crops. Twelve miles from Winchester I could have
bought land for 50 shillings the acre, but nearer the town the
price of cleared land is from three to four pounds. Several
Europeans who have settled hereabouts have not succeeded
well, and for the reason that they failed to discard European
customs. It should not be overlooked that the price of labor
and that of produce is in reverse proportion to what prevails
in Europe. Here labor is high and market values, net, are
low. An especial error of foreigners is the attempt to improve
too fast. A Frenchman who has bought 300 acres of
land thinks he has a &#8216;property,&#8217; and goes to work on the grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
scale. What with building and embellishments he is very apt
to go bankrupt. There are men in this region who have made
fortunes in land speculations. There is not a tavern at Winchester
where land merchants may not be found. They are
as enthusiastic in their offers as the women who sell toothpicks
at the doors of Paris restaurants and caf&eacute;s. An especially
pleasing feature of their preliminaries is that they
assure you their only motive is to make your fortune. I met
one of these merchants who desired to enrich me, <i>nolens
volens</i>, by selling me land at an excessively high price.</p>

<p>&#8220;Winchester is destined to be a manufacturing town, and
to a degree incalculable as soon as communication with the
Atlantic coast shall have been established by means of the
rivers or by canal. Already there is a famous carriage works
at Winchester; and boots, shoes, and saddles are made there,
which, for use and for style of workmanship, equal the
product of the older cities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I set out from Winchester for Bath at 4 o&#8217;clock in the
morning, in order to be on the mountain before the sun was
too high. A light fog covered the Valley, resembling transparent
gauze, through which appeared the tops of trees,
houses and cabins, the cabin chimneys already smoking. I
observed that the squirrels were early awake. Coming to
Bath, I found the great subject of talk was a duel lately
fought and announced in the <i>Gazette</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h3>1.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE following are the observations of young Isaac Weld,
of Dublin. He was on his way from Philadelphia,
and stopped at the Falls of the Potomac:</p>

<p>&#8220;From hence I followed the course of the river downwards
as far as George Town, where I again crossed it, and after
passing through the Federal city, proceeded along the Maryland
shore of the river to Piscatoway, and afterwards to Port
Tobacco. In the neighborhood of Piscatoway there are several
very fine views of the Virginian shore; Mount Vernon
in particular appears to great advantage. From Port Tobacco
to Hoe&#8217;s Ferry on the Potowmac River, the country is
flat and sandy and wears a most dreary aspect. Nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
to be seen here for miles together but extensive plains that
have been worn out by the culture of tobacco, overgrown with
yellow sedge and interspersed with groves of pine and cedar
trees, the dark green colour of which forms a curious contrast
with the yellow of the sedge. In the midst of these
plains are the remains of several good houses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a number of roads in different directions cross over
these flats, upon none of which is there anything like a direction
post, and the face of a human being is so rarely met with
that it is scarcely possible for a traveler to find out the direct
way at once. Instead of twelve miles, the distance by the
straight road from Port Tobacco to the ferry, my horse had
certainly traveled twice the number before we got there. After
having waited for two hours and a half for my breakfast, the
most I could procure was two eggs, a pint of milk and a bit
of cake bread, scarcely as big as my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;After having got into the ferry-boat the man of the house,
as if conscious that he had given me very bad fare, told me
that there was a bank of oysters in the river, close to which it
was necessary to pass, and that if I chose to stop the men
would procure abundance of them for me. The curiosity of
getting oysters in fresh water tempted me to stop, and the
men got near a bushel of them in a very few minutes. These
oysters are extremely good when cooked, but very disagreeable
eaten raw; indeed all the oysters found in America are,
in the opinion of most Europeans, very indifferent and tasteless
when raw. The Americans, on their part, find still
greater fault with our oysters, which, they say, are not fit to
be eaten in any shape, because they taste of copper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>&#8220;The river at the ferry is about three miles wide, and with
particular winds the waves rise very high; in these cases they
always tie the horses, for fear of accidents, before they set
out; indeed with the small open boats which they make use
of it is what ought always to be done, for in this country gusts
of wind rise suddenly. Having omitted this precaution, the
boat was on the point of being overset two or three different
times as I crossed over. On the Virginian shore, opposite to
the ferry house from whence I sailed, there are several large
creeks, which fall into the Potowmac. As I wished to go
beyond these creeks I therefore hired the boatman to carry
me ten miles down the Potowmac River in the ferry-boat,
past the mouths of them all; this he accordingly did, and
in the afternoon I landed on the beach, not a little pleased
at finding that I had reached the shore without having been
under the necessity of swimming any part of the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The part of the country where I landed appeared to be a
perfect wilderness. Taking a road, however, as nearly as I
could guess, in a direct line from the river up the country,
at the end of an hour I came upon a narrow road, which led
to a large old brick house, somewhat similar to those I had
met with on the Maryland shore. On inquiring here from
two blacks for a tavern, I was told there was no such thing in
this part of the country. In the course of five or six miles I
saw several more of the same sort of old brick houses, and
the evening now drawing toward a close, I began to feel the
necessity of going to some one of them. I was considering
within myself which house I should visit, when a lively old
negro, mounted on a little horse, came galloping after me. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
applying to him for information on the subject, he took great
pains to assure me that I should be well received at any of
the houses I might stop at, and strongly recommended me to
proceed under his guidance to his master&#8217;s house, which was
but a mile farther on.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Masser will be so glad to see you,&#8217; added he; &#8216;nothing
can be like.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accordingly took the negro&#8217;s advice and rode to the
dwelling of his master, made him acquainted with my situation,
and begged I might be allowed to put my horse in his
stable for the night. The reception, however, which this gentleman
gave me differed so materially from what I had been
led to expect, that I was happy at hearing from him that there
was a good tavern at the distance of two miles. I apologized
for the liberty I had taken, and made the best of my way to it.
Instead of two miles, however, this tavern proved to be about
three times as far off. The next day I arrived at Stratford,
the residence of a gentleman, who, when at Philadelphia,
had invited me to pass some time with him whenever I visited
Virginia. Some of the neighbouring gentlemen dined
here together, and having related to them my adventures on
arriving in Virginia, the whole company expressed the greatest
astonishment. Every one seemed eager to know the name
of the person who had given me such a reception, and begged
me to tell it. I did so, and the Virginians were satisfied, for
the person was a Scotsman, and had, it seems, removed but a
short time before from some town or other to the plantation
on which I found him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>&#8220;This part of Virginia is called the Northern Neck, and
is remarkable for having been the birthplace of many of the
principal characters which distinguished themselves in America,
during the war, by their great talents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though many of the houses in the Northern Neck are
built of brick and stone, in the style of the old English manor
houses, yet the greater number there and throughout Virginia
are of wood, amongst which are all those that have been built
of late years. This is chiefly owing to a prevailing, though
absurd, opinion, that wooden houses are the healthiest, because
the inside walls never appear damp. Tobacco is not
near so much cultivated now as it was formerly, the great
demand for wheat having induced most of the planters to
raise that grain in preference. Those who raise tobacco and
Indian corn are called planters, and those who cultivate small
grain, farmers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Towards the end of April I crossed the Rappahannock
River, which bounds the Northern Neck on one side, to a
small town called Tappahannock, or Hobb&#8217;s Hole, containing
about 100 houses. Before the war this town was in a much
more flourishing state than at present; that unfortunate contest
ruined the trade of this little place, as it did that of most
of the seaport towns in Virginia. The Rappahannock is
about three-quarters of a mile wide opposite the town. Sharks
are very often seen in this river. What is very remarkable,
the fish are all found on the side of the river next to the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I passed through this part of the country, from Tappahannock
to Urbanna, I observed many traces of fires in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
woods, which are frequent, it seems in the spring of the year.
I was a witness myself to one of these fires, that happened in
the Northern Neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day had been remarkably serene; in the afternoon,
however, it became sultry, and streams of hot air were perceptible
now and then, the usual tokens of a gust. About 5
o&#8217;clock the horizon towards the north became dark, and a
terrible whirlwind arose. I was standing with some gentlemen
on an eminence at the time, and perceived it gradually
advancing. As it came along it leveled the fence rails, and
unroofed the sheds for the cattle. We made every endeavor,
but in vain, to get to a place of shelter; in the course of two
minutes the whirlwind overtook us; the shock was violent; it
was hardly possible to stand, and difficult to breathe. The
whirlwind passed over in about three minutes, but a storm,
accompanied by heavy thunder and lightning, succeeded. On
looking round immediately after the whirlwind had passed a
prodigious column of fire now appeared in a part of the wood
where some brushwood had been burning; in many places
the flames rose considerably above the summit of the trees,
which were of a large growth. It was a tremendous, and at
the same time sublime sight. The negroes in the surrounding
plantations were all assembled with their hoes, and
watches were stationed at every corner to give the alarm if
the fire appeared elsewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;The country between Urbanna and Gloucester is neither so
flat nor so sandy as that bordering upon the Rappahannock.
The trees, chiefly pines, are of very large size, and afford
abundance of turpentine, which is extracted from them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
large quantities by the inhabitants, principally, however, for
home consumption. Gloucester contains only ten or twelve
houses. There are remains here of one or two redoubts
thrown up during the war. The town of York consists of
about seventy houses, an Episcopalian church, and a gaol.
Great quantities of tobacco were formerly inspected here;
very little, however, is now raised in the neighborhood. The
little that is sent for inspection is reckoned to be of the very
best quality, and is all engaged for the London market. In
the town the houses bear evident marks of the siege; and the
inhabitants will not, on any account, suffer the holes perforated
by the cannon balls to be repaired on the outside. Till
within a year or two the broken shells themselves remained;
but the New England men that traded to York, finding they
would sell well as old iron, dug them up and carried them
away in their ships. Twelve miles from York, to the westward,
stands Williamsburg. The town consists of about
1,200 inhabitants, and the society in it is thought to be more
extensive and more genteel at the same time than what is to
be met with in any other place of its size in America. No
manufactures are carried on here, and scarcely any trade.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Williamsburgh to Hampton the country is flat and
uninteresting. From this town there is a regular ferry to
Norfolk, across Hampton Roads, eighteen miles over. Norfolk
would be a place of much greater trade than it is at
present were it not for the impolicy of some laws which have
existed in the State of Virginia. One of these laws, so injurious
to commerce, was passed during the war. It was
enacted that all merchants and planters in Virginia, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
owed money to British merchants, should be exonerated from
their debts if they paid the money due into the public treasury
instead of sending it to Great Britain. The treasury at
first did not become much richer in consequence of this law.
However, when the continental paper money became so much
depreciated many of the people began to look upon the measure
in a different point of view. In vain did the British merchant
sue for his money when hostilities were terminated; he
could obtain no redress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another law, baneful in the highest degree to the trading
interest, is one which renders all landed property inviolable.
Owing to this law they have not yet been enabled to get a
bank established at Norfolk. Repeated attempts have been
made in the State Assembly to get this last mentioned law
repealed, but they have all proved ineffectual. The debates
have been very warm on the business.</p>

<p>&#8220;The houses in Norfolk are about 500 in number. These
have all been erected since the year 1776, when the town was
totally destroyed by fire. The losses suffered on that occasion
were estimated at &pound;300,000. Amongst the inhabitants are
great numbers of Scotch and French. The latter are almost
entirely from the West Indies, and principally from St. Domingo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of fodder was to be had on the whole road from
Norfolk to Richmond, excepting at two places. Oats were
not to be had on any terms. Great crowds were assembled at
Petersburgh, as I passed through, attracted to it by the horse
races, which take place four or five times in the year. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
only particular circumstance in their mode of carrying on
their races in Virginia is that they always run to the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richmond is situated immediately below the falls of
James River, on the north side. The river opposite to the
town is crossed by the means of two bridges, which are separated
by an island. The bridge, leading from the south shore
to the island, is built upon fifteen large flat-bottomed boats,
kept stationary in the river by strong chains and anchors. The
bows of them, which are very sharp, are put against the
stream, and fore and aft there is a strong beam, upon which
the piers of the bridge rest. The bridges thrown across this
river, opposite the town, have repeatedly been carried away;
it is thought idle, therefore, to go to the expense of a better
one. The strongest stone bridge could hardly resist the bodies
of ice that are hurried down the falls by the floods on the
breaking up of a severe winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though the houses in Richmond are not more than 700
in number, yet they extend nearly one mile and a half along
the banks of the river. The lower part of the town is built
close to the water, and opposite to it lies the shipping. This
is connected with the upper town by a long street, which runs
parallel to the course of the river, about fifty yards removed
from the banks. The situation of the upper town is very
pleasing; it stands on an elevated spot, and commands a fine
prospect of the falls of the river and of the adjacent country
on the opposite side. The best houses stand here, and also
the Capitol, or State house. From the opposite side of the
river this building appears extremely well.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>&#8220;A canal is completed at the north side of the falls, which
renders the navigation complete from Richmond to the Blue
Mountains, and at particular times of the year boats with
light burthens can proceed still higher up. In the river, opposite
the town, are no more than seven feet of water, but
ten miles lower down about twelve feet. Most of the vessels
trading to Richmond unload the greatest part of their cargoes
at this place into river craft, and then proceed up to the town.
Trade is carried on here chiefly by foreigners.&#8221;</p>


<h3>2.</h3>

<p>Isaac Weld, who spent about two years in this country,
from 1795 to 1797, returned to Ireland &#8220;without entertaining
the slightest wish to revisit the American continent.&#8221;
During his visit he saw a great deal, wrote a very good book
after going home (an extraordinary book as the work of a
very young man), and it is a matter of congratulation that he
came. Weld was a little past twenty-one when he landed at
Philadelphia. He was born in Dublin, of influential family
connections, and had the advantage in his youth of an acquaintance
with the Martineaus, those exceptionally intelligent
people. Isaac Weld died in 1856. He had been for
years vice-president of the Royal Dublin Society, and was
famous as a topographer. Some account has already been
given of his tour through the Northern Neck to Richmond.
The observations continue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Having stayed at Richmond somewhat longer than a week,
which I found absolutely necessary, if it had only been to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
recruit the strength of my horses, I proceeded in a north-westerly
direction towards the Southwest or Green Mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first week in May had arrived; the trees had obtained
a considerable part of their foliage, and the air in the woods
was perfumed with the fragrant smell of numberless flowers
and flowering shrubs. The music of the birds was also delightful.
It is thought that in Virginia the singing birds are
finer than what are to be met with on any other part of the
continent, as the climate is more congenial to them. The
notes of the mocking-bird, or Virginian nightingale, are in
particular most melodious. It is a remark, however, made by
Catesby, and which appears to be a very just one, that the
birds in America are much inferior to those in Europe in
the melody of their notes, but that they are superior in point
of plumage. I know of no American bird that has the rich,
mellow note of our blackbird, the sprightly note of the skylark,
or the sweet and plaintive one of the nightingale. After
having listened to the mocking-bird, there is no novelty in
hearing the song of any other bird in the country; and indeed,
their songs are, for the most part, but very simple in themselves,
though combined they are pleasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The frogs in America, it must here be observed, make a
most singular noise, some of them absolutely whistling, whilst
others croak so loudly that it is difficult at times to tell
whether the sound proceeds from a calf or a frog; I have
more than once been deceived by the noise when walking in
a meadow. These last frogs are called bullfrogs; they mostly
keep in pairs, and are never found but where there is good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
water; their bodies are from four to seven inches long, and
their legs are in proportion; they are extremely active, and
take prodigious leaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first town I reached on going towards the mountains
was Columbia, or Point of Fork, as it is called in the neighborhood.
It is situated about sixty miles above Richmond,
at the confluence of Rivanna and Fluvanna Rivers, which
united form James River. This is a flourishing little place,
containing about forty houses, and a warehouse for the inspection
of tobacco. On the neck of land between the two
rivers, just opposite to the town, is the magazine of the State,
in which are kept 12,000 stand of arms, and about thirty tons
of powder. The low lands bordering upon the river in this
neighborhood are extremely valuable.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Columbia to the Green Springs, about twenty miles
farther on, the road runs almost wholly through a pine forest,
and is very lonely. Night came on before I got to the end of
it, and, as very commonly happens with travelers in this part
of the world, I soon lost my way. A light, seen through the
trees, seemed to indicate that a house was not far off. My
servant eagerly rode up to it, but the poor fellow&#8217;s consternation
was great indeed when he observed it moving from him,
presently coming back, and then with swiftness departing
again into the woods. I was at a loss for a time myself to
account for the appearance. I found it proceeded from the
firefly. As the summer came on these flies appeared every
night. After a light shower in the afternoon I have seen the
woods sparkling with them in every quarter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>&#8220;After wandering about till it was near 11 o&#8217;clock, a plantation
at last appeared, and having got fresh information respecting
the road from the negroes in the quarter, who generally
sit up half the night, and over a fire in all seasons, I
again set out for the Green Springs. With some difficulty I
at last found the way, and arrived there about midnight. The
hour was so unseasonable that the people at the tavern were
very unwilling to open their doors. Besides the tavern and
the quarters of the slaves, there is but one more building at
this place. This is a large farmhouse, where people that resort
to the springs are accommodated with lodgings about as
good as those at the tavern. The springs are just on the margin
of the wood at the bottom of a slope which begins at the
houses, and are covered with a few boards merely to keep the
leaves from falling in. The waters are chalybeate, and are
drank chiefly by persons from the low country, whose constitutions
have been relaxed by the heats of summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having breakfasted in the morning at this place, I proceeded
on my journey up the Southwest Mountain. In the
course of the day&#8217;s ride I observed a great number of snakes,
which were now beginning to come forth from their holes. I
killed a black one that I found sleeping, stretched across the
road; it was five feet in length. The black snake is more
commonly met with than any other in this part of America.
It is wonderfully fond of milk, and is frequently found in
the dairies, which in Virginia are for the most part in low
situations like cellars.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Southwest Mountains run nearly parallel to the Blue
Ridge, and are the first which you come to on going up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
country from the sea coast in Virginia. The soil here changes
to a deep argilaceous earth, particularly well suited to the
culture of small grain and clover, and produces abundant
crops. As this earth, however, does not absorb the water very
quickly the farmer is exposed to great losses from heavy falls
of rain. On the sides of the mountain, where the ground has
been worn out with the culture of tobacco, and the water has
been suffered to run in the same channel for a length of time,
it is surprising to see the depth of the ravines, or gullies, as
they are called. However, the country in the neighborhood
of these mountains is far more populous than that which lies
towards Richmond; and there are many persons that even
consider it to be the garden of the United States. The salubrity
of the climate is equal also to that of any part of the
United States; and the inhabitants have in consequence a
healthy, ruddy appearance. The people appeared to me to
be of a more frank and open disposition, more inclined to
hospitality, and to live more contentedly on what they possessed
than the people of the same class in any other part of
the United States I passed through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Along these mountains live several gentlemen of large
landed property, who farm their own estates, as in the lower
parts of Virginia; among the number is Mr. Jefferson. His
house is at present in an unfinished state, but if carried on
according to the plan laid down, it will be one of the most
elegant private habitations on the United States. Several
attempts have been made in this neighborhood to bring the
manufacture of wine to perfection; none of them, however,
have succeeded to the wish of the parties. A set of gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
once went to the expense even of getting six Italians over for
the purpose. We must not, however, conclude that good wine
can never be manufactured upon these mountains. It will
require some time, and different experiments, to ascertain
the particular kind of wine, and the mode of cultivating it
best adapted to the soil of these mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having crossed the Southwest Mountains I passed along
to Lynchburgh, a town situated on the south side of Fluvanna
River. This town contains about 100 houses, and a warehouse
for the inspection of tobacco, where about 2,000 hogsheads
are annually inspected. It has been built entirely
within the last fifteen years, and is rapidly increasing, from
its advantageous situation for carrying on trade with the
adjacent country. The boats, in which the produce is conveyed
down the river, are from forty-eight to fifty-four feet
long, but very narrow in proportion to their length. Three
men are sufficient to navigate one of these boats, and they can
go to Richmond and back again in ten days. They fall down
with the stream, but work their way back again with poles.
The cargo carried in these boats is always proportioned to
the depth of water in the river, which varies very much.
Along the banks I observed great quantities of weeds hanging
upon the trees considerably above my head, though on
horseback. A few miles from Lynchburgh, towards the Blue
Mountains, is a small town called New London, in which
there is a magazine and also an armory, erected during the
war. About fifteen men were here employed, as I passed
through, repairing old arms and furbishing up others. At
one end of the room lay the musquets, to the amount of about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
5,000, all together in a large heap, and at the opposite end
lay a pile of leathern accoutrements, absolutely rotting for
want of common attention. All the armories throughout the
United States are kept much in the same style.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between this place and the Blue Mountains the country
is rough and hilly, and but very thinly inhabited. The few
inhabitants, however, met with here are uncommonly robust
and tall; it is rare to see a man amongst them who is not six
feet high. These people entertain a high opinion of their own
superiority in point of bodily strength over the inhabitants
of the low country. A similar race of men is found all along
the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond the Blue Ridge, after crossing by this route near
the Peaks of Otter, I met with but very few settlements till
I drew near to Fincastle, in Bottetourt County. This town
was only begun about the year 1790, yet it already contains
sixty houses, and is most rapidly increasing. The improvement
of the adjacent country has likewise been very rapid,
and land now bears nearly the same price that it does in the
neighborhood of York and Lancaster, in Pennsylvania. The
inhabitants consist principally of Germans, who have extended
their settlements from Pennsylvania along the whole
of that rich tract of land which runs through the upper part
of Maryland, and from thence behind the Blue Mountains
to the most southern part of Virginia. They have many
times, I am told, crossed the Blue Ridge to examine the land,
but the red soil which they found there was different from
what they had been accustomed to.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>&#8220;The difference indeed between the country on the eastern
and on the western side of the Blue Ridge, in Bottetourt
County, is astonishing, when it is considered that both are
under the same latitude, and that this difference is perceptible
within the short distance of thirty miles. On the eastern side
of the Ridge, cotton grows extremely well; and in winter
snow scarcely ever remains upon the ground more than a day
or two at a time. On the other side cotton never comes to
perfection, and in every farmyard you see sleighs or sledges.
On the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, in Virginia, not one
of these carriages is to be met with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another circumstance may also be mentioned (besides the
contrast in the soils) as making a material difference between
the country on one side of the Blue Ridge and that on the
other, namely, that behind the mountains the weevil is unknown.
In the lower parts of Virginia, and the other states
where the weevil is common, they always thresh out the grain
as soon as the crops are brought in, and leave it in the chaff,
which creates a degree of heat sufficient to destroy the insect.
According to the general opinion, the weevil originated on
the eastern shore of Maryland, where a person, in expectation
of a great rise in the price of wheat, kept over all his crops
for the space of six years, when they were found full of these
insects. For a considerable time the Potowmac River formed
a barrier to their progress. The Blue Mountains at present
serve as a barrier, and secure the country to the westward
from their depredations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bottetourt County is entirely surrounded by mountains.
The climate is particularly agreeable. It appears to me that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
there is no part of America where the climate would be more
congenial to the constitution of a native of Great Britain or
Ireland. In the western part of the county are several medicinal
springs, whereto numbers of people resort towards the
latter end of summer. Those most frequented are called the
Sweet Springs. A set of gentlemen from South Carolina
have, I understand, since I was there, purchased the place
and are going to erect several commodious dwellings in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;The country immediately behind the Blue Mountains,
between Bottetourt County and the Potowmack River, is
agreeably diversified with hill and dale, and abounds with
extensive tracts of rich land. The natural herbage is not so
fine here as in Bottetourt County, but when clover is once
sown it grows most luxuriously; wheat also is produced in as
plentiful crops as in any part of the United States. Tobacco
is not raised excepting for private use, and but little Indian
corn is sown, as it is liable to be injured by the nightly frosts,
which are common in the spring. The whole of this country
to the west of the mountains is increasing most rapidly in
population. In the neighborhood of Winchester it is so
thickly settled that wood is now beginning to be thought valuable.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I passed along the road from Fincastle to the Potowmack,
which is the high road from the Northern States to
Kentucky, I met with great numbers of people from Kentucky
and the new State of Tennessee going towards Philadelphia
and Baltimore, and with many others going in a
contrary direction &#8216;to explore,&#8217; as they call it, that is to search<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
for lands conveniently situated for new settlements in the
western country. These people all travel on horseback, with
pistols or swords, and a large blanket folded up under their
saddle. There are now houses scattered along nearly the
whole way from Fincastle to Lexington, in Kentucky. It
would be still dangerous for any person to venture singly;
but if five or six travel together they are perfectly secure.
Formerly travelers were always obliged to go forty or fifty in
a party.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first town you come to, going northward from Bottetourt
County, is Lexington, a neat little place that did contain
about 100 houses, a courthouse and gaol, but the greater
part of it was destroyed by fire just before I got there. Thirty
miles farther on stands Staunton. This town carries on a
considerable trade with the back country, and contains nearly
200 dwellings, mostly built of stone, together with a church.
Winchester stands 100 miles to the northward of Staunton,
and is the largest town in the United States on the western
side of the Blue Mountains. The houses are estimated at
350.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Duke of La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt was born
January 11, 1747, and died in 1827. He was in this
country, of which he made a thorough investigation,
during the years 1795, 1796 and 1797, having been obliged
to quit France in 1792 by reason of the insanities of the
Revolution. It is stated that his education was neglected.
He was early in the army, and was in England in 1769. On
his return from England he made a practical application of
the methods of agriculture he had studied in that country.
He set up a model farm on his estate, and established a school
of arts and trades for the sons of soldiers, which, in 1788,
numbered 130 students. It was he who made the answer to
Louis XVI, &#8220;No, sire, it is Revolution,&#8221; when the King observed,
&#8220;This seems to be a revolt.&#8221; He turned over a part
of his fortune to the King. From 1792 to 1795, and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
his return from America, he was in England, being much
with Arthur Young, the famous agriculturist. Returning
to France in 1799, he continued his scientific and philanthropic
works, and (as much as was possible) was active in
public affairs. He was the organizer of the first savings bank.</p>

<p>The two large volumes of travels in this country by the
Duke of La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt were translated, and
published at London in 1799. These volumes are a record,
and a summary of statistics for that period of the history of
this country such as are not to be found elsewhere, the work
of a man who had an eye for both the intimate and the exterior
concerns of the State. France was a volcano in those
years, and the observer was glad to give an undivided attention
to the facts of the new country across the seas. Below
are a few statements bearing on Virginia, taken from the
second volume of this remarkable book. The traveler came
by ship, three days from Charleston to Norfolk, landing May
29th [1796].</p>

<p>&#8220;Norfolk is built on Elizabeth River, at nine miles from
the spot where it discharges its waters into the bay. In the
intervening space there are few houses. An almost uninterrupted
succession of pines are the only object which meets
the traveler&#8217;s eye. Erancy Island lies nearly in the middle
of the river at a short distance above its mouth. Two points
of land, which approach within a quarter of a mile of each
other in front of Norfolk, are strengthened with forts which
are capable of successfully defending the entrance. Portsmouth,
a small assemblage of houses on the opposite side of
the river, did not share in the conflagration of Norfolk. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
its situation it seemed entitled to expect all the commerce of
Elizabeth River; at its quays the greatest depth of water is
found. But at the conclusion of the peace, the inhabitants,
being incensed against the English, refused to admit any
merchant of that nation, or any newcomer whose political
principles were liable to suspicion. The consequence has
been that the inhabitants have removed to the opposite side;
that Norfolk has been rebuilt, and that its trade is twenty
times more considerable than that of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the close of the year eighty-three there were not yet
twelve houses rebuilt at Norfolk. At present the number is
between 700 and 800. Last year the yellow fever is said to
have carried off 500 persons from a population of 4,000. The
inhabitants of Norfolk, even those among them who are the
most opulent, fancy that the use of wine and strong liquors
furnishes them with a preservative. Previous to the war the
town is said to have contained 8,000 inhabitants. Norfolk
carries on a considerable trade with Europe, the Antilles,
and the Northern States. Her exports are wheat, flour, Indian
corn, timber of every kind, particularly planks, staves
and shingles; salt meat and fish, iron, lead, flaxseed, tobacco,
tar, turpentine, hemp. All these articles are the produce of
Virginia, or of North Carolina, which latter State, having
no seaports, or none that are good, makes her exportations
principally through those of Virginia. This port almost
singly carries on all the commerce of that part of Virginia
which lies south of the Rappahannoc, and of North Carolina
far beyond the Roanoke. They are at present forming a
canal which, passing through the Dismal Swamp, is to unite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the waters of the south branch of Elizabeth River, or rather
of Deep Creek, with Albemarle Sound. What must appear
very surprising is that for this canal, which already seems
in such a state of forwardness, no levels have been taken. It
is thus almost all the public works are carried on in America,
where there is a total want of men of talents in the arts, and
where so many able men, who are perhaps at this moment
unemployed in Europe, might to a certainty make their fortunes
at the same time that they were rendering essential
service to the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The European demand has within four years more than
doubled the value of the exports from Norfolk. A barrel of
flour, whose medium value in 1791 was $5.55, rose in 1795
to $9.35; and Indian corn was at 37 cents the bushel in 1791,
at 54 in 1792, and at 66 in 1795. Exclusive of the flour exported
from Norfolk, there is drawn from the State, through
that and other ports, a great quantity of wheat, which is taken
by the merchants of Philadelphia and New York, or the
millers of Brandywine, who manufacture it into flour, which
they export to Europe. Good mills are not very common in
Virginia. The exportation of tobacco from Norfolk has by
the diminution of the culture of that article in Virginia, been
reduced above one-third within the last five years. The medium
rate of house rent at Norfolk is $230. Many English
commercial houses are established at Norfolk. This year
England procured from Virginia a number of horses to
mount the cavalry, which she proposes to send to the French
islands. Of 400 horses already shipped off, only 150 lived
to reach the place of their destination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>&#8220;Agriculture can hardly be said to exist in Norfolk County
or in that of Princess Ann. The landed property is much
divided, and the inhabitants devote themselves rather to the
selling of timber than to the cultivation of the soil. In all
these parts land is sold at from $6 to $7 per acre; and often
the value of the timber, which it offers for the axe, amounts
to four or five times the price of the original purchase. From
eighty to ninety vessels of different dimensions are annually
built at Norfolk. The price of building is, for the hull on
coming from the hands of the carpenter, $24 per ton for those
above 120 tons. Ready for sea, they cost from $47 to $50
per ton. It was intended that Norfolk should build one of
the six frigates of which the United States had determined
to compose their marine. That which was to have been built
at Norfolk was among the number countermanded: it was
begun at Gosport, where there are dock yards for the construction
of the largest vessels. The communication between
Norfolk and Portsmouth is continual: it is carried on by six
rowboats belonging to a company, and by three scows, in
which horses and carriages are conveniently ferried over. The
fare for each passenger is one-sixteenth of a dollar; but on
paying $6 a person may become free of the passage for twelve
months. To the port of Norfolk, above any other in the
United States, came the greatest number of colonists escaped
from Saint Domingo. Private subscriptions raised in all the
towns of Virginia, together with further sums voted by the
State Legislature and by Congress, afforded the unfortunate
French incontestable proofs of the benevolence and generosity
of the Americans. Major William Lindsey, commissioner of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the Custom House, is, of all the inhabitants of Norfolk, the
individual with whom I have the most particular reason to be
satisfied. He is a man recommended by simplicity of manners
and goodness of heart, and is held in universal esteem.
I am profoundly indebted to him for information on a variety
of subjects.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wherry, employed in transporting the mail from Norfolk
to Hampton, whence it is forwarded by land to Richmond,
is the usual conveyance for passengers who intend to
pursue that route. In good weather the passage is performed
in two hours: we were ten hours in crossing for want of wind.
The Richmond mail arrives at Hampton, an inconsiderable
village, three times a week. Formerly there was a custom
house established here. In 1795 this was united with that of
Norfolk. The monument voted by Congress for erection at
York Town is not even yet begun. Such negligence is inconceivable,
shameful and unaccountable. On the opposite side
of the river from York Town, in Gloucester County, are annually
built a considerable number of vessels. The highest
rents at York Town are from $80 to $100. Flour, an article
which it is difficult to procure, costs at present $15. From
York Town to Williamsburg land is sold at $4 or $5 the acre.
The students at the college in Williamsburg pay $14 to each
professor whose course of lessons they attend. Their board
and lodging cost them from $100 to $120. The lands about
Williamsburg yield from eight to twelve bushels of wheat
per acre, or from twelve to fourteen of Indian corn. Those
few spots that are manured with dung produce double that
quantity. Crowded in the stage by ten passengers and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
baggage, we did not arrive at Richmond before 11 o&#8217;clock at
night, though we had set out from Williamsburg at 8 in the
morning; the rain, which has been abundant during the
last two days, having rendered the roads very bad.</p>

<p>&#8220;The position of Richmond is truly agreeable. On the
opposite side of the river the country rises in a gentle aclivity;
and the little, but well-built town of Manchester, environed
by cultivated fields, which are ornamented by an infinite
number of trees and dotted with scattered houses, embellishes
the sweet, variegated, agreeable and romantic perspective.
This town has prodigiously increased, but within
the last two or three years it has remained stationary. A few
years back a conflagration consumed almost all the lower part
of the town. At present there are few wooden houses at Richmond.
The trade of this town consists in the purchase of the
country productions, and in selling at second-hand the articles
of domestic consumption, which are generally procured from
England. The number of merchants who carry on a direct
commerce with Europe is inconsiderable. They keep their
ships at Norfolk, and send down the produce of the country
in smaller vessels. The commission trade may be considered
as the real business of the place. It is from the merchants of
Richmond or Petersburg that those of Norfolk most commonly
purchase the grain, flour and tobacco which the latter
export. The country produce is paid for by the merchants
in ready money or at short credit; they even frequently obtain
it on cheaper terms by furnishing the planters with an
advance of money on their crop. The Richmond merchants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
supply all the stores through an extensive tract of back country.
As they have a very long credit from England, they can
allow a similar indulgence of six, nine or twelve months to
the shop-keepers whom they supply. All the merchants deal
in bills of exchange on Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The falls of James River, which obstructed its navigation
from the distance of seven miles above Richmond, heretofore
imposed the necessity of employing land carriage for that
space. At present a canal, running parallel with the course
of the river for those seven miles, connects the communication
by water, and opens a navigation which extends without
interruption 200 miles above Richmond. I have seen one of
the two mills at Richmond. It stands below the falls of the
river, receives a great power of water, and turns six pair of
stones. It is a fine mill, and unites the advantages of all the
new inventions: the cogs of the wheels are clumsily executed.
It costs a yearly rent of near $6,000 to Monsieur Chevalier,
a Frenchman from Rochefort, heretofore director of the
French paquets to America, and now settled in Virginia.
Flour mills are more numerous at Petersburg than at Richmond,
and the mills there are also upon a good construction.
The exportations of Petersburg are more considerable than
those of Richmond, although generally speaking, the produce
it receives is inferior in quality. Tobacco, for instance, which
sells at Richmond for $6 or $7 the hundred weight, does not
fetch quite $5 at Petersburg. City Point, or Bermuda Hundred,
is the spot where the custom house is established for
these two places. At half a mile from the custom house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
stands the habitation of Mr. D. Randolph, who is fully entitled
to the reputation which he enjoys of being the best farmer
in the whole country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inspection of tobacco in Virginia, and especially on
James River, is esteemed to be conducted with a degree of
exactness and severity, which contributes as much as the real
superiority of the article itself to keep up its price in the
market. The hogsheads are broken at the warehouse, and
examined in every direction and in every part. The tobacco
is then repacked in its hogshead, which is branded with a
hot iron, marking the place of inspection and the quality of
the contents. The planter receives a certificate of the particulars.
It is by selling this &#8216;tobacconote&#8217; to the merchant that
the planter sells his tobacco. The civil laws of Virginia have
struck me as wisely ordained. The State of Virginia has no
public debt, except $100,000, in which she was found debtor
to the Union on the settlement of the accounts of the States
with the general government; and a claim made on the part
of France for arms and military stores furnished during the
war. From the condition of the finances of the State of Virginia
it follows that the taxes are by no means heavy. The
counties impose no taxes, unless when they have bridges,
prisons or courthouses to build. The slave laws are much
milder here than in any of the other countries through which
I have hitherto traveled.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 20th of June Mr. Guillemard and myself set out
for the mountains; Monticello, the habitation of Mr. Jefferson,
was the object of this part of our journey. Messrs. Graham
&amp; Havens, merchants of Richmond, and owners of a coal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
mine at Dover, near by, were so kind as to conduct us thither.
This mine is scarcely wrought. There is not one person
throughout America versed in the art of working mines. The
country between Dover and Goochland Courthouse, where we
stopped at night, is more variegated than before; you find
there more heights, and some fine prospects, especially on
Mount Pleasant, which commands a wide extensive vale entirely
cleared, and full of houses and clumps of trees. This
day was a court day at Goochland. It was near 9 o&#8217;clock at
night when I arrived. At the inn the company easily discerned
that I was a Frenchman. There arrived a large bowl
of grog, and we drank one after another, toasting the French,
France, America, Virginia, and M. de la Fayette, whose
name they mentioned with enthusiasm. In spite of my little
disposition for drinking, I was obliged two or three times to
drink in my turn, for it was absolutely necessary to empty
the bowl. It was with great difficulty I prevented the arrival
of a second. The road grows duller after you leave Goochland
Courthouse. The plantations become constantly less
frequent and less extensive. Inns are very scarce on this
road; the next is nearly seventeen miles distant from that
where we passed the night. I went a mile farther on, to stop
at one which I knew was kept by a Frenchman. After having
spent nearly the whole day there, we went ten miles farther
on to an ordinary, where we stopped for the night, and
the next day proceeded to Monticello.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s house commands one of the most extensive
prospects you can meet with; when finished by his new plan,
it will certainly deserve to be ranked with the most pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
mansions in France or England. He has divided all his land
under culture into four farms, and every farm into seven
fields of forty acres. His system of rotation embraces seven
years. Mr. Jefferson possesses one of those excellent threshing
machines, which a few years since were invented in Scotland.
He has a drilling machine, invented in his own neighborhood.
Mr. Jefferson, in common with all landholders in
America, imagines that his habitation is more healthy than
any other; that it is as healthful as any in the finest parts of
France. In private life Mr. Jefferson displays a mild, easy,
and obliging manner, though somewhat cold and reserved;
he possesses a stock of information not inferior to that of any
other man. His daughters have been educated in France,
where they became acquainted with my family. Fifteen
hundred leagues from our native country, in another world,
and frequently given up to melancholy, we fancy ourselves
restored to existence when we hear our family and our friends
mentioned by persons who have known them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We arrived at Staunton by the road through Rockfish
Gap. The most frequented road to the Sweet, Warm and
Hot Springs at Greenbriar, and from thence to Kentucky,
passes through Staunton. Eight inns are established there,
three of which are large. Hemp, which grows very fine, is
cultivated throughout the whole of this country. Wheat in
this region is mowed with the sickle, as in Europe, and is infected
with the rot. On the other side of the Blue Mountains
they mow with the scythe. From Staunton we passed by
Keyssel Town, Newmarket, Strasburgh (formerly called
Stover&#8217;s Town), and Newtown, to Winchester. Winchester<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
sends to Alexandria the whole produce of the upper country,
and draws from Baltimore, but especially from Philadelphia,
all sorts of dry goods. Upwards of thirty well-stocked stores,
or shops, have been opened at Winchester. The town contains
ten or twelve inns, large and small, which are often full.
In the course of last year upwards of 4,000 persons passed
through the place, going to settle in Tennessee or Kentucky.
Landed property in the vicinity of Charlestown is more divided,
perhaps, than in any other part of Virginia. Very
few of the planters possess more than 2,000 acres of land, and
few even so much. Alexandria is, beyond all comparison, the
handsomest town in Virginia, and, indeed, is among the finest
in the United States. Alexandria carries on a constant trade
with the West India Islands, and also some with Europe.
There is a bank at Alexandria, the only one in Virginia. The
establishment of a bank at Richmond was authorized by the
Legislature of Virginia in December, 1792, but the subscriptions
not filling it does not exist.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;The roads are in general good throughout this State; and
although the inns are sometimes bad, yet upon the whole they
are better than in the other States. Those in the back country,
where I have traveled, are preferable to the inns in many
of the most inhabited parts of New England.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the year 1798 John Davis came to America. He had
been very much of a traveler, had lived in the East Indies,
had crossed the equator several times and doubled
the Cape of Good Hope more than once. Davis came from
Salisbury, in England. He deserves a place in the biographical
dictionaries, but is not found there. Having been a sailor
before the mast for eleven years, he became a desultory man
of letters, of considerable literature, who paid his way while
in this country by potboiling for New York and Philadelphia
booksellers and by teaching in South Carolina and Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>
He brought with him across the Atlantic a library of 300
volumes, French, Latin and English. These books he read.
For statistics, commerce, land speculations, Davis cared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
nothing whatever. He was an impressionist and not to be
disregarded as a poet. His work, therefore, is distinct among
these early travels which are usually records of fact as fact,
and as such are extremely valuable. However a man sees,
let him write.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson, who was pleased to accept the dedication
to him of this volume, supposed that it would be of a statistical
sort. &#8220;Should you in your journeyings have been led to
remark on the same objects on which I gave crude notes some
years ago, I shall be happy to see them confirmed or corrected
by a more accurate observer,&#8221; wrote President Jefferson from
Monticello.</p>

<p>Davis accepted the acceptance and published a book as
little like the &#8220;Notes on Virginia&#8221; as any book could well be.
The author had read Horace and believed as that poet did
that his work was going to last. &#8220;That this volume will regale
curiosity while man continues to be influenced by his
senses and affections, I have little doubt,&#8221; was the statement
of John Davis in his preface. &#8220;It will be recurred to with
equal interest on the banks of the Thames and those of the
Ohio. There is no man who is not pleased in being told by
another what he thought of the world and what the world
thought of him.&#8221; There is a good deal of truth in both the
particular and the general observation. We have not yet
taken the time to review our history with much care. Whenever
that is done, John Davis, of Salisbury, citizen of the
world, more or less, should find readers again after a hundred

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>Having translated for bookseller Caritat, in New York
(at Aaron Burr&#8217;s suggestion), &#8220;The Campaign in Italy of
General Buonaparte,&#8221; and afterwards having spent a winter
as tutor in the family of Mr. Drayton, of South Carolina,
Davis came back to the North, wrote a novel called the &#8220;Wanderings
of William,&#8221; for Thompson, of Philadelphia, and,
nevertheless, being in want of ready money, applied to Mr.
Burr, now Vice-President, for a recommendation that might
lead to government employment. The Vice-President very
obligingly promised the indigent author a place in the Treasury
Department. Davis set out for Washington, which at
that time had only begun to emerge. The village of 1801 is
thus described, as if by Goldsmith: &#8220;Washington, on my second
journey to it wore a very dreary aspect. The multitude
had gone to their homes, and the inhabitants of the place were
few. There were no objects to catch the eye but a forlorn
pilgrim forcing his way through the grass that overruns the
streets, or a cow ruminating on a bank, from whose neck depended
a bell, that the animal might be found the more readily
in the woods. I obtained accommodations at the Washington
Tavern, which stands opposite the Treasury. There
I found seven Cherokee chiefs. They came to be instructed
in the mode of European agriculture.&#8221; Presenting himself
to Secretary Gallatin immediately after the Cherokee chiefs
had descended the Treasury stairs, Davis was told by the Secretary
that the Vice-President had made a mistake, and that
there was no consulship or any other office to be had. Another
instance of the startling difference between promise and fulfilment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>&#8220;Finding a schooner at Georgetown ready to sail for Alexandria,
I put my trunk on board of her, and left without regret
the Imperial City. The wind being contrary, we had
to work down the Potomac. The river here is very beautiful.
Mason&#8217;s Island forms one continued garden; but what particularly
catches the eye is the Capitol, rising with sacred
majesty above the woods. It was easier landing at Alexandria
in America than Alexandria in Egypt; and I found
elegant accommodations at Gadesby&#8217;s hotel. It is observable
that Gadesby keeps the best house of entertainment in the
United States. The splendour of Gadesby&#8217;s hotel not suiting
my finances, I removed to a public-house kept by a Dutchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;To what slight causes does a man owe some of the principal
events of his life. I had been a fortnight at Alexandria,
when, in consequence of the short advertisement I had put
in the <i>Gazette</i>, a gentleman was deputed to wait on me from
a Quaker, on the banks of the Occoquan, who wanted a Tutor
for his children. The following evening I left Alexandria
on horseback to visit the abode of Mr. Ellicott. Having
crossed the bridge [at Colchester], which is built over the
Occoquan, I alighted at the door of the tavern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having ordered supper, I gazed with rapture on the Occoquan
River, which ran close to the house, and, gradually enlarging,
emptied itself into the capacious bosom of the Potomac.
The fishermen on the shore were hawling their seine,
and the sails of a little bark, stemming the waves, were distended
by the breeze of night. The seaboy was lolling over
the bow, and the helmsman was warbling a song to his absent
fair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>&#8220;The next day I proceeded to Occoquan; but so steep and
craggy was the road that I found it almost inaccessible. On
descending the last hill, I was nearly stunned by the noise of
two huge mills, whose roar, without any hyperbolical aggravation,
is scarcely inferior to that of the great falls of the
Potomac, or the cataract of Niagara. My horse would not
advance; and I was myself lost in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend Ellicott and his wife received me with an unaffected
simplicity of manners, whom I was happy to catch
just as they were going to dinner. An exquisite Virginia
ham smoked on the board, and two damsels supplied the
guests with boiled Indian corn, which they had gathered with
their own hands. Friend Ellicott, uncorrupted by the refinement
of modern manners, had put his hat to its right use,
for it covered his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our agreement was soon made. Quakers are men of few
words. Friend Ellicott engaged me to educate his children
for a quarter of a year. He wanted them taught reading,
writing, and arithmetic. Delightful task! As to Latin or
French, he considered the study of either language an abuse
of time; and very calmly desired me not to say another word
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No place can be more romantic than the view of Occoquan
to a stranger, after crossing the rustic bridge, which
has been constructed by the inhabitants across its stream.
He contemplates a river urging its course along mountains
that lose themselves among the clouds; he beholds vessels
taking on board flour under the foam of the mills, and others
deeply laden expanding their sails to the breeze; while every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
face wears contentment, every gale wafts health, and echo
from the rocks multiplies the voices of the waggoners calling
to their teams.</p>

<p>&#8220;No walk could be more delightful than that from Occoquan
to Colchester, when the moon was above the mountains.
You traverse the bank of a placid stream over which impend
rocks, in some cases bare, but more frequently covered with
an odoriferous plant that regales the traveller with its fragrance.
So serpentine is the course of the river that the
mountains, which rise from its bank, may be said to form an
amphitheatre; and nature seems to have designed the spot
for the haunt only of fairies; for here grow flowers of purple
dye, and here the snake throws her enamelled skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;After clambering over mountains, almost inaccessible to
human toil, you come to the junction of the Occoquan with
the noble river of the Potomac, and behold a bridge, whose
semi-elliptical arches are scarcely inferior to those of princely
London. And on the side of this bridge stands a tavern,
where every luxury that money can purchase is to be obtained
at a first summons; where the richest viands cover the table,
and where ice cools the Madeira that has been thrice across
the ocean.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> The apartments are numerous and at the same
time spacious; carpets of delicate texture cover the floors;
and glasses are suspended from the walls in which a Goliah
might survey himself. No man can be more complaisant than
the landlord. Enter but his house with money in your pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and his features will soften into the blandishments of delight;
call and your mandate is obeyed; extend your leg and the
boot-jack is brought you.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the north bank of the Occoquan is a pile of stones,
which indicates that an Indian warrior is interred underneath.
The Indians from the back settlements, in traveling
to the northward, never fail to leave the main road, and visit
the grave of their departed hero. If a stone be thrown down,
they religiously restore it to the pile; and, sitting round the
rude monument, they meditate profoundly; catching, perhaps,
a local emotion from the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;A party of Indians, while I was at Occoquan, turned
from the common road into the woods to visit this grave on
the bank of the river. The party was composed of an elderly
Chief, twelve young War Captains, and a couple of Squaws.
Of the women, the youngest was an interesting girl of seventeen;
remarkably well shaped, and possessed of a profusion of
hair, which in colour was raven black. She appeared such
another object as the mind images Pocahontas to have been.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians being assembled round the grave, the old
Chief rose with a solemn mien, and, knocking his war-club
against the ground, pronounced an oration to the memory of
the departed warrior. No orator of antiquity ever exceeded
this savage chief in the force of his emphasis, and the propriety
of his gesture. Indeed, the whole scene was highly dignified.
The fierceness of his countenance, the flowing robe,
elevated tone, naked arm, and erect stature, with a circle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
auditors seated on the ground, and in the open air, could not
but impress upon the mind a lively idea of the celebrated
speakers of ancient Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having ended his oration, the Indian struck his war-club
with fury against the ground, and the whole party
obeyed the signal by joining in a war-dance&mdash;leaping and
brandishing their knives at the throats of each other, and
accompanying their menacing attitudes with a whoop and a
yell, which echoed with ten-fold horror from the banks of the
river. The dance took place by moonlight, and it was scarcely
finished, when the Chief produced a keg of whiskey, and having
taken a draught, passed it round among his brethren.
The squaws now moved the tomahawks into the woods, and a
scene of riot ensued. The keg was soon emptied. The effects
of the liquor began to display itself in the looks and motions
of the Indians. To complete the scene, the old warrior was
uttering the most mournful lamentations over the keg he had
emptied; inhaling its flavour with his lips, holding it out
with his hands in a supplicating attitude, and vociferating
to the bye-standers, &#8216;Scuttawawbah! Scuttawawbah! More
strong drink! More strong drink!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;About eight miles from the Occoquan mills is a house of
worship, called Powheek Church; a name it derives from a
Run that flows near its walls. Hither I rode on Sundays
and joined the congregation of Parson Weems. I was confounded
on first entering the church-yard at Powheek to hear</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;<i>Steed threaten steed with high and boastful neigh.</i>&#8217;</p>

<p>Nor was I less stunned with the rattling of carriage-wheels,
the cracking of whips, and the vociferations of the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
to the negroes who accompanied them. But the discourse of
Parson Weems calmed every perturbation.</p>

<p>&#8220;After church I made my salutations to Parson Weems,
and having turned the discourse to divine worship, I asked
him his opinion of the piety of the blacks. &#8216;Sir,&#8217; said he, &#8216;no
people in this country prize the Sabbath more seriously than
the trampled-upon negroes. They are swift to hear; they
seem to hear as for their lives.&mdash;How, sir, did you like my
preaching?&#8217; &#8216;Sir,&#8217; cried I, &#8216;it was a sermon to pull down the
proud and humble the haughty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been three months at Occoquan. My condition was
growing irksome. I, therefore, resigned my place to an old
drunken Irishman, who was traveling the country on foot in
search of an Academy. I remonstrated with Friend Ellicott
on the impropriety of employing a sot to educate his children.
&#8216;Friend,&#8217; said he, &#8216;of all the schoolmasters I ever employed,
none taught my children to write so good a hand, as a man
who was constantly in a state that bordered on intoxication.
They learned more of him in one month than of any other
in a quarter. I will make trial of Burbridge.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Davis returned to New York, collecting a few dollars at
Philadelphia, due him from sales of &#8220;The Wanderings of
William.&#8221; In April, 1802, he was at Washington again,
where Congress was in session. &#8220;I watched an opportunity
to make the Vice-President my salutations as he came out of
the Capitol. He demonstrated no little pleasure to see me;
and his chariot being at the steps, he took me home with him
to dine.&#8221; The House of Representatives was then sitting in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
a detached temporary building. Davis thought John Randolph
the most eloquent in debate. After a few days in
Washington, the itinerant passed on to Prince William
County, where he had been engaged as tutor by Mr. Ball at
twenty-five pounds the quarter. At Frying Pan, in Prince
William County, Davis inquired the way. &#8220;How far, my
boy,&#8221; said I, &#8220;is it to Frying Pan?&#8221; &#8220;You be in the Pan
now,&#8221; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frying Pan is composed of four log huts and a meeting-house.
It took its name from a curious circumstance. Some
Indians, having encamped on the run, missed their frying
pan in the morning, and hence the name was conferred on
the place. I did not stop at Frying Pan, but prosecuted my
walk to Newgate, where in the piazza of the tavern I found a
party of gentlemen from the neighboring plantations carousing
over a bowl of toddy and smoking segars. No people
could exceed these men in politeness. On my ascending the
steps to the piazza every countenance seemed to say: This
man has a double claim to our attention because he is a stranger.
In a moment there was room made for me to sit down;
a new bowl was called for, and every one who addressed me
did so with a smile of conciliation. The higher Virginians
seem to venerate themselves as men. Whatever may be advanced
against Virginians, their good qualities will ever outweigh
their defects; and when the effervescence of youth has
abated, when reason asserts her empire, there is no man on
earth who discovers more exalted sentiments, more contempt
for baseness, more love of justice, more sensibility of feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
than a Virginian. At Newgate my pilgrimage was nearly at
an end, for Mr. Ball&#8217;s plantation was only distant eight
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond Newgate, Bull Run was to be crossed. Having
passed that famous stream, the pedagogue and peripatetic,
after a mile or two, came to the Ball plantation. An old negro
showed him the way, who related, among many other
things, that when he was a young buck he made as much as
fifteen dollars one winter as capitation money&mdash;&#8220;Master, I
don&#8217;t tell you a word of a lie&#8221;&mdash;levied on the wolves of the
region. At Mr. Ball&#8217;s: &#8220;In my way through the garden I
passed two young ladies gathering roses, who, however immured
in the woods, were clad with not less elegance than the
most fashionable females of Europe. I asked them whether
Mr. Ball was at home. They replied that their papa was in
the parlour, and with much sweetness of manner directed
me by the shortest path to the house. Mr. Ball<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> received me
with undissembled accents of joy. He said he had long expected
my coming and was gratified at last. I was not a little
delighted with the suavity of his manners and the elegance
of his conversation. I now opened what some called an
Academy and others an Old Field School; and, however it
may be thought that content was never felt within the walls
of a seminary, I for my part experienced an exemption from
care and was not such a fool as to measure the happiness of
my condition by what others thought of it. Of the boys I
can not speak in very encomiastic terms. Of my female students<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
there was none equal in capacity to Virginia. Geography
was one of our favorite studies. I often addressed the
rose of May in an appropriate ode&mdash;</p>

<p>What with a horse, the artisanry of verse, a mild philosophy,
and the business of his office, John Davis spent three
months very agreeably on Bull Run, within sight of the Blue
Ridge. Then a New Jersey farmer of the neighborhood discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
that his eldest boy wrote a better hand than the
teacher. Davis resigned the academy to the carpenter of the
plantation. &#8220;I now once more seized my staff and walked
towards Baltimore. It was a killing circumstance to separate
from Virginia (the student of geography), but who shall
persume to contend against fate? <i>Phyllida amo ante alias,
nam me discedere flevit.</i> I embarked August, 1802, in the
good ship Olive, Captain Norman, lying at Baltimore, for
Cowes, in the Isle of Wight.&#8221;</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
